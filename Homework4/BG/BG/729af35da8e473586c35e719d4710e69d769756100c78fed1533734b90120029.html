</figure><p>The first time Alexis Magana drove over to her friend Brandon Mestas&rsquo; house, she asked how to find it.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oh, you'll know,&rsquo;&rsquo; he told her. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the one blasting country.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>It was Brandon&rsquo;s mom, Pati Mestas, who was the household&rsquo;s country music fanatic. Pati Mestas, 67, of California, died in Las Vegas while listening to that favorite music. Magana remembered her as someone who was &lsquo;&lsquo;fearless and bold&rsquo;&rsquo; and always welcoming, from that very first day they met.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;She really was a firecracker,&rsquo;&rsquo; Magana wrote to The Associated Press in a Facebook message. &lsquo;&lsquo;I just never dreamed she'd be taken from us in an instant. Our firecracker is gone and now it&rsquo;s just dark.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Brandon Mestas, 33, wrote on his Facebook page that his mother surely enjoyed herself in her final moments.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;She left this world surrounded by friends, singing and dancing with thousands of people. If I had to write the script myself, I could not have done a better job,&rsquo;&rsquo; he wrote.</p><h3 class="subhead">

He was a giver. He was always there for any of his friends or family. If he could, he would help out wherever he could. He was a good man.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He was my younger brother, but I always aspired to be him.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>The brothers grew up northwest of Bakersfield in Shafter, California. As teens, much of their lives revolved around music, going to concerts and cars.</p><p>Victor Link and Gonzales, who wasn&rsquo;t hurt in Sunday&rsquo;s shooting, had been to several country music concerts over the last several years. Going to concerts &lsquo;&lsquo;was their favorite thing to do,&rsquo;&rsquo; Craig Link said.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He was so blessed to have Lynne in his life,&rsquo;&rsquo; Craig Link said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Those two had an amazing love that very, very few people are blessed to understand and enjoy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p></p><h3 class="subhead">

Both were country music fans, and they went to the Route 91 Harvest Festival together, said Laura Shipp&rsquo;s mother, Joyce Shipp.</p><p>They were together until just before a gunman opened fire Sunday night.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We really don&rsquo;t know what happened, just that she went to the bathroom and nobody saw her after that,&rsquo;&rsquo; Joyce Shipp said of her 50-year-old daughter, a dispatcher at an air conditioner company.</p><p>After her son, a Marine Corps reservist, spent more than a day trying to find out what had happened to Shipp, he was notified she was dead.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not doing great,&rsquo;&rsquo; Joyce Shipp said of her grandson. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just trying to get his arms around all this but he&rsquo;s surrounded by his friends and family.
