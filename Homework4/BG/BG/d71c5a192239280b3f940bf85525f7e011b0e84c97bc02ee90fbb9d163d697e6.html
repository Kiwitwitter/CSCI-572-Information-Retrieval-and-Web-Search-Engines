Kennedy who had said he was "anxious to get a look at that boy" — meaning 19-year-old rookie Tony Conigliaro — was as delighted as the rest of the fans when in his first time at bat, Conigliaro hit the first pitch for a home run.

				<div class="description">April 16, 1964: Opening day at Fenway Park raised $36,818 for the Kennedy Memorial Library Fund, as a share of the ticket proceeds were designated to aid the Memorial Library. At that time the library was expected to be built in Cambridge. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy who had said he was "anxious to get a look at that boy" — meaning 19-year-old rookie Tony Conigliaro — was as delighted as the rest of the fans when in his first time at bat, Conigliaro hit the first pitch for a home run.</div>
