<p>Belichick made plenty of interesting moves this offseason, refusing to stand pat with his roster despite winning another title. And while five games into the season isn&rsquo;t a big enough sample to make definitive statements about the moves, almost none of them are working out according to plan.</p><amp-iframe width="auto" height="220" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms" layout="fixed-height" frameborder="0" src="https://c.a0bg.com/Fragment/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/skins/leaf/story/dynamic_newsletter.jpt?section=%2fsports%2fpatriots&googleArticle=yes"></amp-iframe>

<p>The 3-2 Patriots have had the opposite of the Golden Touch this year. They are being carried by Tom Brady and his usual sidekicks, while the newcomers are struggling to adapt.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look:</p><p>
<span class="span bullet_square"><span class="span web_specialcharacters">■</span></span>&nbsp; Cornerback Stephon Gilmore and tight end Dwayne Allen.</p><p>We lump these two together to make a comparison. The Patriots chose to sign Gilmore and trade for Allen instead of re-signing Logan Ryan and Martellus Bennett.</p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

</div>   
<p>Bennett, 30, signed with the Packers in free agency for $8.05 million, with nothing guaranteed beyond 2017. Ryan, 26, signed with Tennessee for $10 million cash and cap this year, and $10 million next year. Both years are guaranteed.</p><p>Gilmore, 27, signed a five-year deal with the Patriots, with $31 million fully guaranteed for two seasons and $17 million in actual take-home pay this year. And Allen, 27, costs the Patriots $5 million this year, with nothing guaranteed beyond the season. The Patriots also gave the Colts their fourth-round pick and received a sixth-rounder as part of the Allen trade.</p><p>In sum, Bennett and Ryan cost $18 million this year, while Gilmore and Allen cost $22 million plus draft capital.</p><p>Gilmore hasn&rsquo;t been that bad when he&rsquo;s on the same page as the rest of the defense and covering the right man. But he&rsquo;s been at the heart of the Patriots&rsquo; communication issues, and hasn&rsquo;t come close to justifying his contract yet.</p><p>That the Patriots are No. 32 in the league in pass defense, while allowing five 300-yard passers, after giving Gilmore a massive contract to improve the secondary is confounding. There&rsquo;s no question that Gilmore is more physically talented than Ryan (who isn&rsquo;t off to the best start in Tennessee, either) but there&rsquo;s something to be said for Ryan knowing the Patriots defense cold and having good chemistry with his teammates.</p><p>As for Allen, he has been a total bust as the No. 2 tight end. Allen has no catches and just six targets in five games, and clearly doesn&rsquo;t have the trust of Brady yet. </p><p>Bennett, meanwhile, had 55 catches for 701 yards and a team-high seven touchdowns last year. He has 20 receptions for 194 yards but no touchdowns this season. Bennett costs $3 million more and is three years older, but he&rsquo;s really only on a one-year contract, as is Allen. Allen is a fairly good run blocker, but so is Bennett. And Allen cost the Patriots a higher draft pick, too.</p><p>Maybe swapping out Ryan for Gilmore will pay off later in the season, and maybe Allen will come around in the passing game. But right now, the Patriots look like they may have just been better off re-signing Bennett and Ryan and using the cap savings elsewhere.</p><p></p><div class="wide">

<span class="span bullet_square"><span class="span web_specialcharacters">■</span></span>&nbsp; Wide receiver Brandin Cooks.</p><p>Cooks certainly hasn&rsquo;t been bad. He has 379 receiving yards (75.8 per game), his three catches of 40-plus yards are tied for the NFL lead, and his 21.1 yards per catch are second (minimum 10 catches).</p><p>But Cooks hasn&rsquo;t been great, either. He looked like he would be a transcendent, big-play receiver during training camp, but he has only 18 catches so far, an average of 3.6 per game. </p><p>He tends to go quiet for long stretches, such as when he went without a catch for 2&frac12; quarters in the loss to Carolina, or when he was shut down all game by Saints rookie cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Cooks also has been kept out of the end zone in four of his five games. </p><p>Cooks isn&rsquo;t physical, and he is fifth behind Rob Gronkowski, Danny Amendola, James White, and Chris Hogan on Brady&rsquo;s list of go-to receivers. </p><p>The Patriots traded away the No. 32 overall pick for Cooks; they could have taken a talented offensive lineman or someone like speedy linebacker Zach Cunningham, who has looked impressive so far for the Texans.</p><p>However, they probably were smart to acquire another veteran to bolster their receiving corps. Cooks has helped ease the sting of Julian Edelman&rsquo;s season-ending injury, and has contributed more to this team than the No. 32 pick would have at this point.</p><p></p><div class="wide">

<span class="span bullet_square"><span class="span web_specialcharacters">■</span></span>&nbsp; Defensive end Kony Ealy.</p><p>For a team that prides itself on not being wedded to a certain scheme, and being able to mold its schemes around the skills of its players, the Patriots&rsquo; decision to release Ealy during training camp in late August sure is a head-scratcher.</p><p>Ealy, still only 25 years old, was claimed by seven teams the next day, and he went to the Jets, who had the highest waiver priority. Ealy has been terrific for Gang Green, recording 11 total pressures (two QB hits and nine hurries), an interception, and five passes batted down in four games while playing 57 percent of snaps. He also costs just $900,000 in this, the last year of his contract.</p><p>The Patriots, though, decided that they couldn&rsquo;t get anything out of Ealy and simply cut him loose. This was after trading down in the draft from the 64th pick to 72nd to acquire him. And it&rsquo;s not like the Patriots couldn&rsquo;t use more help on defense. They&rsquo;re 32nd in total defense, 30th in points allowed, 32nd in pass defense, 24th in run defense, and 28th in sacks per pass play.</p><p>Jets defensive line coach Robert Nunn told the New York Daily News that Ealy &ldquo;excels in a four-man front.&rdquo; The Patriots often play a three-man front, so maybe Ealy just didn&rsquo;t have enough versatility for what they want to do.</p><p>But the Patriots were counting on him to be a part of their defense, and they swung and missed on their evaluation. And to make it worse, the Jets figured out how to use him. The Patriots will likely see him this Sunday in the Meadowlands.</p><p></p><div class="wide">

<span class="span bullet_square"><span class="span web_specialcharacters">■</span></span>&nbsp;The draft.</p><p>The Patriots punted on this year&rsquo;s draft, and maybe that&rsquo;s OK. They want to win now, and draft picks usually take a few years to develop, if they develop at all. </p><p>But the Patriots gave their picks away like candy this year, and are getting almost nothing out of the draft, other than fourth-round pick Deatrich Wise, who has been pretty good.</p><p>Their first-round pick went for Cooks. They traded down for Ealy, then released him. They traded a fifth-round pick for tight end James O&rsquo;Shaughnessy and cut him at the end of camp (six teams then put in a waiver claim for him, and he landed in Jacksonville). Sixth-round pick Conor McDermott was cut and signed with Buffalo.</p><p>The only two that aren&rsquo;t the Patriots&rsquo; fault are third-round defensive end Derek Rivers tearing his ACL, and third-round offensive tackle Tony Garcia suffering a mystery non-football illness. But there&rsquo;s no question that the sum of their draft decisions haven&rsquo;t worked out.</p><p></p><div class="wide">

<span class="span bullet_square"><span class="span web_specialcharacters">■</span></span>&nbsp;Other moves.</p><p>Running back Mike Gillislee has been OK, rushing for 246 yards and four touchdowns but averaging just 3.6 yards per carry. He actually has run the ball pretty well the last couple of games, but the offensive line has been a mess and the Patriots haven&rsquo;t stuck with the run. LeGarrette Blount has 323 yards, one touchdown, and 5.8 yards per carry in Philadelphia, but his numbers would be similar or worse than Gillislee&rsquo;s in the Patriots&rsquo; offense.</p><p>Defensive tackle Lawrence Guy has been pretty good. He has played 57 percent of snaps and has been a force in the run game, collecting 15 tackles. Of course, he is offset by Alan Branch, who was re-signed to a two-year deal but has been in the coaches&rsquo; doghouse all season, earning a healthy deactivation last week.</p><p>Running back Rex Burkhead looks like he could be a threat in the passing game, but hasn&rsquo;t proven that he can stay healthy, missing the last 3&frac12; games with a rib injury. Cassius Marsh has been decent enough in the Chris Long role, showing relentless energy but also taking a few dumb penalties.</p><p>And linebacker David Harris has been America&rsquo;s most expensive cheerleader. The Patriots are paying him about $2.5 million this year, yet he has played just seven snaps all season, none in the past two games. Why he&rsquo;s still on the team is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p><p></p><div class="wide">
