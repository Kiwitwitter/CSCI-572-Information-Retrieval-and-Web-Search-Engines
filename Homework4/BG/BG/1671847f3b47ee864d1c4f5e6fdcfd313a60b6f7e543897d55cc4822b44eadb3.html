	<!----><p></p><p>Top executives from USA Hockey will meet representatives of the women&rsquo;s national team to discuss a wage dispute that could lead to players boycotting the upcoming world championships. <b class="b">John Langel</b>, a lawyer for the players, told the Associated Press Sunday that they'll meet with USA Hockey officials in Philadelphia Monday, two days before the scheduled start of training camp. Players announced Wednesday they'd boycott camp and the tournament unless significant progress is made in negotiations on what they hope is a four-year contract. The International Ice Hockey Federation Women&rsquo;s World Championship begins March 31 in Plymouth, Mich., The US team is the defending champion and has won six of the past eight world championships. Players are seeking a deal that pays them outside the six-month Olympic period; USA Hockey has said it is not in the business of employing players but is still hoping the players picked for the world championships are on the ice when it begins.</p><h3 class="subhead">

</h3><p>
<b class="b">Tessa Worley </b>clinched the seasonlong giant slalom title with a conservative run on a day Federica Brignone led an Italian sweep at the World Cup finals in Aspen. Worley finished fifth to edge American <b class="b">Mikaela Shiffrin </b>by 85 points for her first crystal globe. Brignone glided through the course in a combined time of 1:58.01 to beat teammate <b class="b">Sofia Goggia </b>by 1.44 seconds. <b class="b">Marta Bassino </b>took third<b class="b"> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Andre Myhrer </b>of Sweden won a slalom race at the World Cup finals in Aspen, Colo., when first-run leader <b class="b">Marcel Hirscher </b>of Austria uncharacteristically lost speed near the finish. Myhrer navigated the course in a combined time of 1 minute, 27.97 seconds, holding off <b class="b">Felix Neureuther </b>of Germany by 0.14 seconds. Austria&rsquo;s <b class="b">Michael Matt </b>was third and Hirscher fourth. The 28-year-old Hirscher already clinched the giant slalom and slalom globes, along with his sixth straight overall title. Hirscher held a 0.08-second lead heading into the final run, only to uncharacteristically lose speed near the finish. &lsquo;&lsquo;A mistake, five gates before finish line was not the happiest moment of the season,&rsquo;&rsquo; Hirscher explained. &lsquo;&lsquo;The first half of the run was really good.&rsquo;&rsquo; Before his bottom-of-the-hill hiccup, Hirscher appeared on the verge of his 50th World Cup slalom podium finish. Now, he will have to wait a season to try and join Sweden&rsquo;s <b class="b">Ingemar Stenmark </b>(81) and Italian <b class="b">Alberto Tomba </b>(57) as the only men to achieve that milestone in the discipline .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <b class="b">Eric Frenzel </b>wrapped up an unprecedented fifth straight Nordic combined World Cup title in Schonach, Germany, with his 10th win of the season. The Olympic champion could only have been denied by German teammate <b class="b">Johannes Rydzek </b>going into the final event.</p><p>

<b class="b">Mike Hopkins</b>, long thought to be the next head coach at Syracuse, was hired at Washington, which moved swiftly after firing <b class="b">Lorenzo Romar </b>four days earlier. Hopkins agreed to a six-year deal, with financial terms expected to be released in a few days. Hopkins has been tabbed as the eventual replacement for <b class="b">Jim Boeheim </b>at Syracuse since 2007. Two years ago, Syracuse put the transition plan in writing, announcing Hopkins would take over after the 2017-18 season. Hopkins also served as interim head coach during a stretch of the 2015-16 season while Boeheim was suspended. Perhaps in response Sunday, Boeheim agreed to a new contract that will extend past next season. Boeheim just completed his 41st season as head coach at his alma mater. He ranks second all-time among Division 1 coaches in victories with 903, trailing only Duke&rsquo;s <b class="b">Mike Krzyzewski</b>. Hopkins spent most of the past quarter century at Syracuse as a player and coach. He played at Syracuse from 1989-93 and returned to the staff there in 1996. Romar was dismissed following 15 seasons at his alma mater and the Huskies&rsquo; sixth straight season in missing the NCAA Tournament. The decision was divisive because of Romar&rsquo;s long relationship with the school and his early success in turning Washington into a West Coast basketball power. But that was countered by the team&rsquo;s recent struggles, its last NCAA appearance coming in 2011 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Villanova&rsquo;s <b class="b">Josh Hart</b>, Kansas&rsquo;s <b class="b">Frank Mason III</b>, Purdue&rsquo;s <b class="b">Caleb Swanigan</b>, and UCLA&rsquo;s <b class="b">Lonzo Ball </b>are the finalists for the Naismith Trophy as the top player in men&rsquo;s college basketball. The Atlanta Tipoff Club announced the finalists. The winner will be announced April 2 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Arkansas State scheduled a Monday news conference to introduce Louisville assistant <b class="b">Mike Balado </b>as the Red Wolves&rsquo; coach. Balado, who spent the past four seasons at Louisville, replaces <b class="b">Grant McCasland</b>, who resigned Monday to become head coach at the University of North Texas.</p><p>

<p>The United States is going to the semifinals of the World Baseball Classic for the second time thanks to another impressive home run by <b class="b">Giancarlo Stanton </b>at Petco Park and a spectacular catch at the fence by hometown favorite <b class="b">Adam Jones</b>. Stanton hit a go-ahead, two-run shot into the third-level balcony of the Western Metal Supply Co. Building in the left-field corner in the fourth inning Saturday night and Jones robbed Orioles teammate <b class="b">Manny Machado </b>of a home run in the seventh <a class="a" href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2017/03/19/survives-scare-dominican-republic/7hRZLfo89s4ENrLQspoCmO/story.html">to help the Americans beat the Dominican Republic</a>, 6-3, eliminating the defending champions. Team USA will face Japan on Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium for a spot in the championship game. This is the second time in four editions of the WBC that the United States has advanced to the semifinals. It lost to Japan in 2009 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Indians righthander <b class="b">Cody Anderson </b>will undergo reconstructive elbow surgery and miss the 2017 season. The AL champions said Sunday that Anderson has elected to have the operation after being diagnosed with a ligament sprain. Anderson, 26, made nine starts for Cleveland last season and was expected to begin this year at Triple A Buffalo. Also, second baseman <b class="b">Jason Kipnis </b>is still four to five weeks away from playing in a game as he deals with shoulder inflammation. Kipnis received a second opinion on his shoulder and has been cleared to resume a strengthening program in a week. Outfielder <b class="b">Michael Brantley </b>is expected to make his exhibition debut Monday when the Indians host the Dodgers. Brantley played in only 11 games last year following right shoulder surgery and has been easing his way back in training camp .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Marlins third baseman <b class="b">Martin Prado </b>is expected to miss the start of the regular season after straining his right hamstring at the World Baseball Classic. Playing for Team Venezuela, Prado injured his hamstring running out a ground ball in the sixth inning of Wednesday&rsquo;s loss to Team USA. Marlins manager <b class="b">Don Mattingly </b>already has ruled out Prado playing in any exhibition games. </p><p>

<h2 class="subhead">High five for Federer </h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Roger Federer </b>defeated <b class="b">Stan Wawrinka</b>, 6-4, 7-5, to win a record-tying fifth BNP Paribas Open title in the all-Swiss final in Indians Wells, Calif. At 35 years and seven months, Federer became the oldest champion in the desert tournament&rsquo;s history, surpassing <b class="b">Jimmy Connors</b>, who was 31 years and five months when he won in 1981. Federer tied the tourney record of <b class="b">Novak Djokovic</b>, while winning his 90th career title, keeping him third behind Connors and <b class="b">Ivan Lendl </b>on the all-time list in the Open era. Federer dropped serve just once in five matches, losing the first game of the second set against Wawrinka. In the women&rsquo;s final, <b class="b">Elena Vesnina </b>defeated <b class="b">Svetlana Kuznetsova</b>, 6-7 (6-8), 7-5, 6-4, in an all-Russian final. Vesnina had never advanced beyond the third round in singles and just last year she lost in the first round of qualifying, although she has won three doubles titles at the desert tournament. She beat No. 2 seed <b class="b">Angelique Kerber </b>and No. 12 <b class="b">Venus Williams </b>on her way to the biggest final of her career at age 30. Kuznetsova is 0-3 in finals here, also finishing runner-up in 2007 and 2008. At age 31, Kuznetsova was the fifth-oldest women to reach the final. But the two-time major champion struggled playing with the lead as the No. 8 seed. Kuznetsova led 4-2 in the third before 14th-seeded Vesnina broke her twice in sweeping the final four games of the match .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Six-time champion <b class="b">Novak Djokovic </b>has withdrawn from the upcoming Miami Open because of a lingering right elbow injury. No. 1-ranked <b class="b">Andy Murray </b>withdrew Saturday because of a right elbow injury. Eight-time champion <b class="b">Serena Williams </b>will skip the tournament due to a left knee injury.</p><p>

<h2 class="subhead">Teams USA makes moves </h2>
</h3><p>Defender <b class="b">Matt Besler </b>and attacker <b class="b">Sacha Kljestan </b>have been called up to the US men&rsquo;s national training camp ahead of a key set of World Cup qualifiers. Kljestan replaces the injured <b class="b">Bobby Wood </b>(back) and Besler will bolster the defense. The US team opens training camp in San Jose, Calif., on Monday. The team plays its first qualifier since rehiring <b class="b">Bruce Arena </b>as coach Friday against Honduras in San Jose. The team then travels to Panama for another game four days later. The US team is 0-2 in the final round of the North and Central American and Caribbean region .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <b class="b">Jordan Morris </b>drew a penalty to set up the first goal and scored on a header in the 66th minute to give Seattle the lead as the host Sounders celebrated last year&rsquo;s MLS Cup title with a 3-1 win over the New York Red Bulls. More than 45,000 turned out for Seattle&rsquo;s home opener and were rewarded by goals from <b class="b">Clint Dempsey </b>on a penalty kick, Morris&rsquo;s finish off a beautiful buildup, and <b class="b">Harry Shipp&rsquo;s </b>redirected goal off <b class="b">Joevin Jones&rsquo;s </b>shot in the 79th minute. The loss snapped New York&rsquo;s 18-match unbeaten streak in the regular season dating back to last season. The Red Bulls had not lost an MLS regular-season match since July 3, 2016, a 2-0 loss against New York City FC. Wright-Phillips&rsquo;s goal was his first of the season after leading the league in goals last year. The championship trophy was paraded through the streets of downtown Seattle before the match, then across the field by retired defender <b class="b">Zach Scott </b>and injured captain <b class="b">Brad Evans </b>just before kickoff .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <b class="b">Diego Valeri </b>scored twice and <b class="b">David Guzman </b>got the winner as the Portland Timbers beat the visiting Houston Dynamo, 4-2, late Saturday night. <b class="b">Fanendo Adi </b>also scored for Portland and <b class="b">Jake Gleeson </b>finished with four saves.</p><p>

<h2 class="subhead">T&rsquo;Wolves sign Casspi </h2>
</h3><p>The Timberwolves agreed to terms with free agent forward <b class="b">Omri Casspi</b>, a person with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press. The deal will cover the remainder of the season and does not carry over into next season, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The Wolves arrived in New Orleans on Saturday to finish a three-game road trip. Casspi accompanied <b class="b">DeMarcus Cousins </b>from Sacramento to New Orleans in the blockbuster trade just before the deadline, but he suffered a broken right thumb in his first game with the Pelicans, who were forced to cut him to add another healthy body to the mix as they tried to chase down a playoff spot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Grizzlies forward <b class="b">Chandler Parsons </b>will undergo knee surgery Monday and is expected to miss the remainder of the season. The Grizzlies announced Sunday that Parsons will have a procedure to repair a partial tear of the medial meniscus in his left knee. Parsons signed a four-year, $94 million contract last summer as the Grizzlies&rsquo; biggest free agent acquisition, but he averaged just 6.2 points and played only 34 games this season while his minutes were limited because of knee problems. He didn&rsquo;t play more than 25 minutes in any game this season .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The struggling Hawks got more bad news: All-Star forward <b class="b">Paul Millsap </b>will miss at least two more games with a left knee injury, while guard <b class="b">Kent Bazemore </b>is expected to miss at least a week with a bruised right knee.</p><p>

<p>Former San Francisco 49ers wide receiver <b class="b">Dwight Clark</b>, best known for making &lsquo;&lsquo;The Catch&rsquo;&rsquo; in the 1981 NFC Championship game, announced he has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Clark, 60, said he was diagnosed with the disease after visits to six neurologists and three ALS specialists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Kenyans <b class="b">Elisha Barno </b>and <b class="b">Hellen Jepkurgat </b>won the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s titles at the Los Angeles Marathon, the 26.2-mile race begins at Dodger Stadium and finishes in Santa Monica at the Pacific Ocean. The winners earned $23,000 each. Barno pulled away from 2015 winner <b class="b">Daniel Limo </b>of Kenya in the final mile of the race, crossing the finish line near the Santa Monica Pier in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 51 seconds. Limo was timed in 2:12.13. Jepkurgat comfortably led the pack throughout the women&rsquo;s race before breaking away in the 13th mile to win in 2:34.24, nearly two minutes ahead of fellow Kenyan <b class="b">Jane Kibii</b>, who finished in 2:36.14 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <b class="b">Feyisa Lilesa </b>of Ethiopia, the marathon silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics, ran the fastest time in five years in winning the New York half-marathon in 1:00.4 seconds. <b class="b">Molly Huddle </b>of the United States won her third straight women&rsquo;s title in the 13.1-mile race, finishing at 1:08.19. <b class="b">Emily Sisson</b>, Huddle&rsquo;s training partner, was second (1:08:21) and Burundi&rsquo;s <b class="b">Diane Nukuri </b>was third (1:09:13) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <b class="b">Gennady Golovkin </b>outlasted <b class="b">Danny Jacobs </b>in a superb 12-round defense of his middleweight titles Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. Both fighters are knockout artists, yet this one went the distance &mdash; the first time GGG has not had a KO in 24 fights, and his first time going 12 rounds. The Kazakh won 115-112 on two judges&rsquo; cards and 114-113 on the other. Golovkin keeps his WBC and WBO crowns &mdash; the IBF belt was not at stake because Jacobs skipped that organization&rsquo;s fight-day weigh-in. </p></div>
