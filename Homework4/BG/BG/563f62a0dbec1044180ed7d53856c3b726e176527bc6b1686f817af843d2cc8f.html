	<!----><p>CANTON &mdash; The slim bracelet found with the remains of a young woman discovered in a patch of Dedham woods last week had an engraving that said &ldquo;peace.&rdquo; When authorities seeking help released a photo of the bracelet Friday, someone came forward immediately with a crucial tip: Susan Anyanwu-Corbin, a Boston resident who went missing last year at 22, had a bracelet just like that.</p><p>Working over the weekend, forensic investigators were able to confirm that the remains matched dental records for Anyanwu-Corbin, a Nigerian immigrant who was last seen in February 2016, Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey said Monday.</p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

<p>&ldquo;This does not mark the end of the investigation but, really, it&rsquo;s more like a more difficult beginning,&rdquo; Morrissey said, joined by Dedham police and State Police investigators. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for information about her disappearance &mdash; people who may have socialized with her, resided with her, worked with her, corresponded on Facebook, or even been socially friendly with her, to help us now identify her movements during that period of time&rdquo; when she was last seen.</p><p>Anyanwu-Corbin, described as outgoing and caring, may have been missing for as long as three months before an uncle, George Corbin of Cambridge, reached out to Boston police last May, after being unable to track her down to notify her about a death in the family.</p><p>Her boyfriend at the time of her disappearance, Junior Bernard, told the Globe Monday that her former boyfriend had abused her and threatened her life.</p><p>When Bernard, 24, last saw Anyanwu-Corbin in February 2016, he said, she had a cut on her face where her former boyfriend had punched her, angry that she was dating Bernard.</p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

</div><p>Shortly after those incidents, Bernard said, Anyanwu-Corbin went missing.</p><p>According to police, Corbin, the uncle, was unable to reach her by phone that May and found a new tenant living in what he thought was her Dorchester apartment when he tried to reach her in person. He filed the missing-persons report last May 8, though the poster released by police said she was last seen Feb. 11 around Adams Street in Dorchester. The poster described her as a light-skinned black woman with black hair, brown eyes, and a nose ring, about 5 feet 5 inches tall and 120 pounds.</p><p>A relative who identified himself as a family spokesman but declined to give his name told the Globe Monday that Anyanwu-Corbin came over from Nigeria shortly before her 18th birthday, sponsored by another family member. She attended West Roxbury High School for a time before switching to an alternative diploma program for working adults, while working a series of retail jobs.</p><p>The man, who said he was part of the group of relatives briefed by detectives in person on Sunday, said the family was stunned by the news.</p><p>&ldquo;We were devastated. . . . When we invited them into the home, we were hoping or expecting there was some new development that she was found somewhere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To have it be her death wasn&rsquo;t any part of our expectations.&rdquo;</p><p>The relative said he knew there had been a lag before anyone filed a report but thought it had been only about a month. At first, he said other relatives had assumed Anyanwu-Corbin wanted some space or was &ldquo;lying low, trying to be on her own&rdquo; while working through some &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; in life.</p><p>He described her as a young woman who wanted to become a nurse or work in a medical lab, and who had an interest in fashion and a caring way with younger relatives. </p><p>&ldquo;She was like a big sister, a big cousin, looking out for the young ones all the time,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Bernard said he met Anyanwu-Corbin at school in June 2014 when he went to check his MCAS results. The two quickly became friends and later began dating, a relationship that continued until her disappearance, he said.</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lovable person, and everybody likes her,&rdquo; Bernard said. He said Anyanwu-Corbin didn&rsquo;t drink or smoke and had never been in any trouble. She enjoyed seeing movies, he said, and they had gone together to see one of the &ldquo;Fast and the Furious&rdquo; films at the Somerville Theatre.</p><p>At Boston Adult Technical Academy, an alternative high school downtown for &ldquo;mature, motivated students&rdquo; between the ages of 19 and 22, headmaster Benjamin Helfat described her as &ldquo;popular and enthusiastic,&rdquo; as well as a person with a &ldquo;warm presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was insightful and generous in her contributions to class discussions. Susan was a resilient and determined student despite her life obstacles,&rdquo; Helfat said in a statement. &ldquo;She will be missed. Everyone in our school community passes along their condolences to Susan&rsquo;s friends and family as they cope with this tragic loss.&rdquo;</p><p>Her remains were discovered just before 6 p.m. last Tuesday by a man walking through a low-lying pocket of woods just beyond busy High Street in Dedham, between the back of the town&rsquo;s municipal &ldquo;snow dump&rdquo; and the edge of Brookdale Cemetery.</p><p>After the man picked up what he thought might be a human bone, he called police, who searched that night and the next day and discovered a nearly complete set of remains amid a 50-by-50-yard area, along with a hoodie and pair of sweat pants, a spiral ring, and the bracelet with the &ldquo;peace&rdquo; charm.</p><p>In a photo that was released by authorities Monday &mdash; and that also appeared on a Facebook page for a Susan Corbin of Boston, where months of missing-you messages had been supplanted with notes of mourning &mdash; the young woman could be seen wearing that bracelet, a leather jacket, and a backward baseball cap in a selfie posted as a profile picture on Feb. 10, 2016.</p><p>Morrissey, grateful for last Friday&rsquo;s tip, asked anyone who might have information about Anyanwu-Corbin to call the State Police detective unit attached to the Norfolk District Attorney&rsquo;s Office (781-830-4990) or the Dedham Police Department (781-751-9300).</p><p>&ldquo;[The] information developed to this point does not establish that there was or was not foul play associated with her disappearance and death, and there are a number of important questions still to be answered here,&rdquo; Morrissey said. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking this case very seriously, and we&rsquo;re spending the time and resources. The Boston and the Dedham police departments and the State Police investigators are all working together to try to [understand] what may have happened to Susan in the days and weeks before she was actually missing.&rdquo; </p></div>
