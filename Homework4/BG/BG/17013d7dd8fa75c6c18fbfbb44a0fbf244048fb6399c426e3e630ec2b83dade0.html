<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Arlington Catholic is ready to put the past two seasons after compiling two wins (0-11 in 2016) in its last 22 games. The Cougars&rsquo; underclassmen did gain invaluable experience during that stretch, which should lend itself to a better 2017. One player targeting a turnaround is senior quarterback Michael Burke. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just improved leaps and bounds, and he&rsquo;s come back with a lot more confidence this year,&rsquo;&rsquo; said coach Serge Clivio. Seniors Kordell Parrish and Kieran Mullen provide Burke with a pair of quality targets in the passing game. The Cougars also added 6-foot-5, 260-pound tackle Luke Von-Hunnius (6-5, 260), a transfer from St. Clement. With Catholic Central All-Star Joe Greaney leading a strong group of linebackers, the Cougars appear poised for a turnaround.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 7 p.m., at Watertown</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Austin Prep</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Bill Maradei (39th season). Career: Career: 272-137-4 overall, 172-76 at Austin Prep.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 2-9</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Returning backfield</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Offensive and defensive lines</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Double wing</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Cougars will lean on senior captain Jake Thain (RB/WR) and junior quarterback Matt Rubino as they set their sights on reversing last season&rsquo;s misfortunes. Rubino showed improvement in the preseason. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got experience. He&rsquo;s grown a lot. He&rsquo;s taller and stronger. He&rsquo;s a tough kid who throws a good ball,&rsquo;&rsquo; said coach Bill Maradei, who hopes the offensive and defensive lines can overcome their struggles from last season. &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of opportunity for people to win jobs on the offensive and defensive lines,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 7 p.m., vs. Salem</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Bishop Fenwick</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Dave Woods (20th season). Career: 157-70..</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 7-4</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Quarterback</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Experience on defense, running back</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> It would surprise coach Dave Woods if 2017 isn&rsquo;t the year in which quarterback Cory Bright sets a school record. The junior, who was voted a team captain last November, is three touchdown passes away from tying the school mark of 29. Woods continues to hand the third-year starter more responsibility within the offense. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s great at reading defenses and checking out of plays, but he could also be a fullback in anybody&rsquo;s offense,&rsquo;&rsquo; Woods said of the 5-10, 185-pound signal-caller. Bright threw for more than 2,000 yards and rushed for more than 1,200 as an underclassman.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Saturday, Sept. 9, 2 p.m., vs. Hamilton-Wenham</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Essex Tech</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Dan Connors (1st season). Career: Career: 0-0..</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 4-7</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Veteran running backs, defensive depth</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Inexperience</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Pistol</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Dan Connors, a former team captain at Everett High (2002), moves up to head coach after serving the program as an assistant coach for eight seasons, most recently as offensive coordinator. The Hawks return a pair of backs, senior captain Alec Bolstad and junior Manny Alves, both of whom will lead the offense as it breaks in sophomore quarterback Nick Sauvageau. &lsquo;&lsquo;He is a North/South, punishing power back,&rsquo;&rsquo; Connors said of Bolstad. &lsquo;&lsquo;Manny is the same guy, but they&rsquo;re basically a 1-2 punch. You&rsquo;ll see them splitting carries.&rsquo;&rsquo; A veteran front eight should power the Hawks&rsquo; defense, but junior cornerback Hunter Lane will lead what Connors called a &lsquo;&lsquo;talented group, but an inexperienced group&rsquo;&rsquo; in the secondary.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After sinking to a 2-9 record last fall, Greater Lowell attempts to bounce back with a plethora of playmakers. &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re two deep at receiver, quarterback, running back, and they&rsquo;re all solid high school football players,&rsquo;&rsquo; said coach Shane Abrams. Dual-threat junior QB Jake Newell will target senior wideout R.J. Sawtelle, while senior Adonis Ngin leads the backfield. There are question marks up front, though, where Greater Lowell returns only one starting offensive lineman. &lsquo;&lsquo;We were kind of senior heavy last year and are kind of filling in the gaps with some new guys,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Abrams.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After a 3-8 finish two years ago, the Generals&rsquo; fortunes reversed a year ago, when Jim Pugh directed H-W to a 7-4 mark in his first season. Now the pieces could be in place for the Generals to build on last season&rsquo;s success, starting with quarterback Bill Whelan, who poses a threat for opposing defenses. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s smart, can run the ball, can throw the ball. He&rsquo;s the total package,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Pugh. Whelan has a top target in senior Jake Lanciana (37 receptions in 2016) and has the support of fullback Phil Durgin and tailback Anthony Riccio. &lsquo;&lsquo;He had a great year last year and was our leading ball carrier,&rsquo;&rsquo; Pugh said of Riccio. &lsquo;&lsquo;With that year under his belt we&rsquo;re expecting big things. He&rsquo;s a playmaker.&rsquo;&rsquo; Pugh reserved special praise for Durgin, whom the 28th-year coach called &lsquo;&lsquo;one of the hardest workers I&rsquo;ve ever coached. Phil&rsquo;s one of the hardest workers in the weight room, on the practice field, a very good leader, a long snapper. He does it all, too.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

But if they&rsquo;re going to battle past the mistakes that are a byproduct of inexperience, the Golden Knights need a group of leaders to rally the team. &lsquo;&lsquo;I have to focus on leadership,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Heres. &lsquo;&lsquo;If we&rsquo;re going to be successful it&rsquo;s going to be because of 11 people, not because of who returned.&rsquo;&rsquo; Despite breaking in new starters at all skill positions, the Golden Knights have the talent to achieve similar offensive production to last season when they averaged 30.5 points per game. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our key is to be very disciplined,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Heres. &lsquo;&lsquo;If they do all that stuff, we have the ability to put points on the board.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Baker, who registered 395 yards rushing, 127 yards receiving and six touchdowns in 2016, can also play quarterback in the wildcat. He also serves as one of three leaders on the defense, a group that includes defensive end Chris Lucas (79 tackles, 3 sacks in 2016) and linebacker Mark Companeschi, who led the team with 100 tackles last fall.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> If the Spartans sustain their success on defense -- they yielded just 12.7 points per game last season -- it will be largely due to the work of defensive coordinator John Rafferty. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s simply outstanding,&rsquo;&rsquo; said coach Bob Almeida. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s the best drill person. The way he conducts his defensive sessions are second to none, and the kids have bought in wholeheartedly to what we teach.&rsquo;&rsquo; The Spartans did suffer a major loss with the graduation of standout linebacker Tim Russell, but Almeida remains confident in his replacements. Senior Tre Pignone moves from quarterback into the backfield, where the standout athlete can contribute in a variety of ways. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s such a threat running the ball that we felt it was best to put him at the wing position, where he can run and receive passes,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Almeida. The Spartans shouldn&rsquo;t skip a beat at quarterback with senior Jack McCabe taking the reins. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a leader, number one. He&rsquo;s intelligent,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Almeida. &lsquo;&lsquo;His mechanics are very good, his ball-handling skills are good, and he&rsquo;s an athlete.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

We&rsquo;ve got that senior leadership and we can make some noise.&rsquo;&rsquo; The Wildcats hope the addition of defensive coordinator Lance Little boosts a defense in which Bradley sees growth from last fall. &lsquo;&lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t have linebackers last year that could make the hit behind the line of scrimmage, and I think we have that this year,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;They were young last year and they&rsquo;ve grown over this year, so we&rsquo;re hoping they step up.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

This season should serve as valuable experience for Winthrop&rsquo;s 27 freshmen and sophomores, but some obstacles can be expected early in the year. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a total rehab after coming off a lousy year last year,&rsquo;&rsquo; Driscoll said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s definitely a rebuilding year.&rsquo;&rsquo; Winthrop receives a boost up front from two-way lineman Calvin Tufa, a three-year starter Driscoll calls &lsquo;&lsquo;my best all-around player.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 9-3</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Defensive progression, team Speed, returners up front</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Inexperience at skill positions</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The team&rsquo;s leading rusher as a sophomore and junior, Harry Smith is four touchdowns and 400 yards shy of the program&rsquo;s career records. The senior will be teamed up in the backfield with Will Garcia and junior receivers Anthony Childs and Matt Brogioli to power the spread attack. Seniors Emo Schiappa (6-3, 300) and Zach Kelley (5-10, 250) are three-year starters at the point of attack for a 9-3 squad that advanced to the D3 South quarterfinals.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 7 p.m., at Wareham</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Rockland</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Nick Liquori (1st season). Career: 0-0..</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 5-6</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Experience; deep at linebacker; leadership</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Lack of experience.</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Double wing</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With two players coming back from injury and a new head coach who has been around the program for the last 12 years, the Bulldogs are in a good position to improve upon last year&rsquo;s 5-6 record. A 1995 Rockland grad who won a state title with the program in 1992, Nick Liquori is the head baseball coach as well. Jon Baar, who broke his wrist in the first game of last season, takes over at QB. Conner Shea, who tore his ACL during training camp last year, will start at running back and linebacker. Those two captains lead a 12-player senior class that is determined to make the playoffs. Classmates Zach Sharland (TE/DE), Will Brenmore (MLB/OL) and Lou Casey (T/DT) headline a group ready to win.</p><p>
