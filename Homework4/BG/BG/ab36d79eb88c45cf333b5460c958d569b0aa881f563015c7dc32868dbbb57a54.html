<p class="9on13">Manilow is refreshingly unscripted: You hear his sense of humor, his keen self-awareness, his penchant for self-deprecation.

<p>He&rsquo;s also almost painfully aware of his critics (&ldquo;I really wasn&rsquo;t very good. The audiences were so kind to me, though,&rdquo; he says of his early days) and grateful to his devoted tribe of &ldquo;Fanilows&rdquo; who helped turn a jingle writer from Brooklyn (&ldquo;I am stuck on Band-Aid, &rsquo;cause a Band-Aid&rsquo;s stuck on me&rdquo; and &ldquo;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there&rdquo;) into an international adult contempo superstar, whose hits include &ldquo;Mandy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Copacabana (At the Copa).&rdquo;</p><p>We caught up with the Emmy, Grammy, and Tony winner for a wide-ranging interview, as he readies to sing old favorites and new tracks off his latest record, &ldquo;This Is My Town: Songs of New York&rdquo; at TD Garden Tuesday. He expects this show in Boston to go over a lot better than his first one, 40-plus years ago at Paul&rsquo;s Mall.</p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> Tell me about your new album. What sparked the idea for this love letter to New York?</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> I always had an idea to do a tribute to New York. I always knew it was going to be half standards and half originals. The hard part was choosing the standards. I went on Google just to see songs about New York, and there must&rsquo;ve been 500 songs.</p><p></p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

<p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> What are your first memories of music growing up?</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> I was raised by my grandparents and my mother &mdash; this was not a musical family, but they all knew I was musical, even when I was very young. They had no money, they were barely putting food on the table, and the best they could do was put an accordion in my hands, and [get me] an accordion teacher. I was good at it, I didn&rsquo;t mind it, and the best thing is I learned to read music.</p><p>The beginning of my knowledge of music was when my stepfather Willie Murphy came into my life. He brought a stack of records with him that may as well have been a stack of gold. Those records were the beginning of my musical adventure. Whatever I was feeling when I would play those records, I wanted to keep that feeling forever. I was only 13. But I knew it.</p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> And you started out writing jingles.</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> [To work as] a performer and singer and a guy who makes records &mdash; it never dawned on me that that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d end up. I was happy doing everything in the background. I was happy playing for other singers; I was happy arranging and conducting for other people. I was doing real well writing jingles. They still play a few of them, even 40-something years later. I only got $500 for &ldquo;State Farm is there.&rdquo; [Laughs] Because they buy you out. Nobody expects it to last more than a month. </p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> Then you started accompanying Bette Midler.</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> She was just one singer I was playing piano for and arranging for, but of course she was the best of all of them. It was so obvious she was brilliant. I went on the road with her for no money. For the first few years we were all broke, going from city to city in a little Volkswagen. And [then] it just exploded, the way everyone thought it would for her.</p><p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;d started to write songs of my own, with my collaborators, and because I had no money to hire a bona fide singer, I sang my own demos. And I wasn&rsquo;t bad &mdash; I wasn&rsquo;t great, but I wasn&rsquo;t bad. Those were the years, in the early &rsquo;70s, when singer-songwriters were really the thing &mdash; James Taylor, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, all the record companies were looking for that.</p><p>Bell Records offered me a record contract, which was crazy because I wasn&rsquo;t a singer. I told Bette, &ldquo;I think I got a record contract.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo; [Laughs] I said, &ldquo;Singing.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sing!&rdquo;</p><p>So I made the first record, and you&rsquo;ve got to go on the road and promote it. So I put a band together, and went on the road [in 1974]. I actually played in Boston, I played in a terrible place called Paul&rsquo;s Mall. My God, they hated me at Paul&rsquo;s Mall. That was the first gig ever, ever as a performer. I mean, yes, I agree, I was terrible. I called my manager and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this. I can&rsquo;t go anywhere else.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Just go one more place, in Philadelphia.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll go to Philadelphia.&rdquo; And from Philadelphia on, everything turned better. Audiences liked me. But I&rsquo;ll never forget Paul&rsquo;s Mall.</p><p>So I went on the road as a performer, and the records started to sell. Then we did &ldquo;Mandy,&rdquo; and my life exploded into a million pieces. </p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> You must&rsquo;ve been blown away by the success of that.</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> It was a confusing, terrifying, and exciting time.</p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> You&rsquo;ve said there was an era where you felt hated?</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> The critics were after me, oh my God. I really wasn&rsquo;t very good. The audiences were so kind to me, though. When I was at the piano, I was fine, but when I got up and tried to be funny, I was terrible. But [fans] didn&rsquo;t mind; they were saying, &ldquo;Keep going, we like what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; Critics couldn&rsquo;t stand it. As soon as I had that number one record, oh my God, they tried to annihilate me. I&rsquo;d pull covers over my head and go into self-pity. And then the band, the record company, my family, then all these strangers would tell me, &ldquo;Keep going, there&rsquo;s something happening.&rdquo; The only way I could keep going were the people who kept telling me not to listen [to the critics].</p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> You got a lot of support from your fans when you came out about your marriage [to longtime manager Garry Kief in 2014].</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> Man, did I. We&rsquo;ve been together about 40 years, and I was a little nervous about how people would react, but gee, it couldn&rsquo;t be more positive. The fans I have, they care for me. It&rsquo;s deeper than I would&rsquo;ve ever thought. They really care about me. When they read that I wasn&rsquo;t alone with a dog all my life, that I had someone with me for 40 years, and we&rsquo;re two guys, and we&rsquo;re still together, and still happy, they couldn&rsquo;t have been happier.</p><p></p><p>
<b class="b">Q.</b> Do you have any other memories of Boston that are better than Paul&rsquo;s Mall?</p><p>
<b class="b">A.</b> After [that], all those shows we did in every area of Boston were wonderful, wonderful. I played at the Wang Center, that was beautiful; we&rsquo;ve played theaters, outdoor places, indoor places, I&rsquo;ve played Boston so many years. And whenever I get to &ldquo;Time in New England&rdquo; [from the song &ldquo;Weekend in New England&rdquo;], forget about it. I have to repeat that line four times before I can move on.
