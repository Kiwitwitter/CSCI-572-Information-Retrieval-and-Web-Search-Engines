<p>The Cyclones remained confident, despite having lost 20 straight against ranked opponents. Iowa State&rsquo;s last win over a Top 25 team came against TCU in 2012. It was Iowa State&rsquo;s first road win over a top-five team.</p><amp-iframe width="auto" height="220" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms" layout="fixed-height" frameborder="0" src="https://c.a0bg.com/Fragment/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/skins/leaf/story/dynamic_newsletter.jpt?section=%2fsports&googleArticle=yes"></amp-iframe>

<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;We came in telling our whole team you have to believe for four quarters,&rsquo;&rsquo; Lanning said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Believe you can beat a top-five team in the country. That&rsquo;s what we did today.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Lanning, who switched from quarterback to linebacker in the offseason, played both positions Saturday. According to the Des Moines Register, he&rsquo;s the first Iowa State player since 1971 to get significant action both ways in a game. He ran for 35 yards, passed for 25, and had eight tackles, a sack and a fumble recovery. He played 78 snaps.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;Coming into an atmosphere like this, you can&rsquo;t ask for anything better &mdash; especially playing both ways. It was fun,&rdquo; Lanning said.</p><p class="noprint">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say enough about my teammates and what they did to help me out. It was a lot of stuff going on for me. I didn&rsquo;t have my best game defensively, but we got the win.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

<p>Baker Mayfield passed for 306 yards and rushed for 57 the Sooners.

Our execution as a whole was not good enough. That falls on us as coaches. We haven&rsquo;t played well the last couple of well.

<b class="b">Clemson 28, Wake Forest 14 </b>&mdash; Kelly Bryant passed for 200 yards and a TD before leaving with an ankle injury as the No. 2 Tigers (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) beat the Demon Deacons (4-2, 1-2) to move to 6-0 for a third straight season.</p><p>Bryant left the game in the third quarter after Travis Etienne&rsquo;s 1-yard touchdown run put Clemson ahead, 21-0. Trainers looked at Bryant&rsquo;s ankle and took him into the sideline medical tent. Bryant tested his legs with a few short jogs once he came out and remained on the sidelines with teammates. </p><p class="noprint">Bryant&rsquo;s 28-yard scoring pass to Deon Cain got the Tigers started. Etienne, a freshman, had 67 yards rushing along with his touchdown. Adam Choice added a rushing TD and Cannon Smith added a 13-yard touchdown catch from third-string passer Hunter Johnson.</p><p>
<b class="b">Penn State 31, Northwestern 7 </b>&mdash; Trace McSorley threw for 245 yards and a touchdown, Saquon Barkley ran for two scores, and the No. 4 Nittanny Lions (6-0, 3-0 Big Ten) beat the Wildcats (2-3, 0-2) in Evanston, Ill.</p><p class="noprint">McSorley completed 25 of 34 passes. He threw a 10-yard touchdown to backup quarterback Tommy Stevens in the second quarter and added a 5-yard TD run in the fourth.</p><p>Barkley scored on a 1-yard leap and 53-yard dash in the third quarter to make it 24-0. The Heisman Trophy candidate finished with 75 yards rushing after being held to minus-1 in the first half.</p><p>

The Bulldogs also avenged a 17-16 loss to Vanderbilt last year by beating the Commodores for the 20th time in the last 23 games.</p><p class="noprint">Chubb became the eighth running back in SEC history to reach 4,000 yards rushing in his career.</p><p>
<b class="b">TCU 31, West Virginia 24 </b>&mdash; Kenny Hill avoided a defender in the backfield and lunged forward through two more for a 3-yard touchdown run with 2:53 left and the No. 8 Horned Frogs  (5-0, 2-0) remained the Big 12&rsquo;s only undefeated team with a win over the No. 23 Mountaineers (3-2, 1-1) in Fort Worth Tex.</p><p>Hill also threw a 45-yard touchdown pass and was on the receiving end of a 48-yard score for TCU. His winning TD run came only five plays after an apparent interception was reversed on a replay review.</p><p class="noprint">Will Grier threw for 366 yards and three TDs for West Virginia, including two long catch-and-run scores in a span of about 2&frac12; minutes late in the third quarter.

This one was much closer, but not competitive.</p><p class="noprint">Auburn&rsquo;s Jarrett Stidham completed 14 of 21 passes for 235 yards and two touchdowns. That included a screen pass which Ryan Davis took 75 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, the Tigers&rsquo; longest offensive play of the season.</p><p class="noprint">Auburn&rsquo;s Daniel Carlson made three field goals to become the SEC&rsquo;s career scoring leader with 413 points. Georgia&rsquo;s Blair Walsh set the old mark of 412 points.</p><p>
<b class="b">Miami 24, Florida State 20</b> &mdash; Malik Rosier threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to Darrell Langham with six seconds remaining and the No. 13 Hurricanes (4-0, 2-0 ACC) beat the Seminoles (1-3, 1-2) in Tallahassee, Fla., to end a seven-game losing streak in the series.</p><p class="noprint">Rosier, who came into the game leading the Atlantic Coast Conference in passing efficiency, had a rough start as he completed only four of his first 16 passes.

Eddy Pineiro missed the first extra point of his career in the third quarter and never got a chance to atone for it. He had made 45 in a row before that.</p><p>LSU looked nothing like it did the previous week against Troy, a 24-21 loss that was the program&rsquo;s first at home against a non-conference opponent since 2000.</p><p>
<b class="b"> Western Michigan 71, Buffalo 68</b> &mdash; Jarvion Franklin ran in from the 12 to give the Broncos (4-2, 2-0 MAC) a victory over the host Bulls (3-3, 1-1) in a record-tying seven overtimes with a record-breaking 139 total points.</p><p>Buffalo had just converted on a 25-yard field goal to open the door for Western Michigan, who scored in just four plays.
