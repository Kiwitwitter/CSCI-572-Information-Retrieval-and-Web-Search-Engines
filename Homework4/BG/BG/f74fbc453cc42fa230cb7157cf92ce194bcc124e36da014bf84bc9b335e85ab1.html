<p> Call it the best-kept secret in Massachusetts medicine: Health insurance  companies pay a handful of hospitals far more for the same work even  when there is no evidence that the higher-priced care produces healthier  patients. In fact, sometimes the opposite is  true: Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, earns 15 percent more  than Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for treating heart-failure patients even though government figures show that Beth Israel has for years reported lower patient death rates.</p><!-- total:1 -->

<p> Private insurance data obtained by the Globe's Spotlight Team show that  the Brigham, Mass. General, Children's Hospital, and a few others are,  on average, paid about 15 percent to 60 percent more than their rivals  by insurance companies such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts  and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The gap is even more striking for many  individual procedures, which can be two or three times more expensive in  one hospital than in another.</p><p>  This payment pattern has become a driving force in the state's  galloping healthcare costs, and it raises hard questions about why  certain hospitals and physicians receive premium pay for care that is no  better than that of their competitors. Until now, the growing pay gap  has not been subject to public scrutiny because contracts between  insurers and hospitals typically include confidentiality agreements.</p><!--  working ad -->

<p> But an ongoing Spotlight Team investigation of healthcare in this state  found scores of payment disparities for routine procedures in which  there is no obvious difference in quality. Consider:</p><p> -  Children's Hospital typically gets about $1,100 for making an MRI of  an ankle or a knee, not counting the physician's fee. Insurers pay  Boston Medical Center $490 for the same procedure, using a similar  high-tech machine.</p><p> -  The technician who makes a simple chest X-ray to help diagnose pain  or an insistent cough brings in $75 at Anna Jaques Hospital in  Newburyport. Mass. General earns more than twice as much, $160, for  producing the same image.</p><p> -  The cost of Catherine Murphy's care was $5,309.15 for two days in  Winchester Hospital to treat the pneumonia she contracted soon after her  wedding earlier this year. Had she gone to Brigham and Women's instead,  similar care would have cost more than $9,000, according to a Spotlight  Team analysis of insurance records.</p><p> The dramatic payment gaps have emerged over the last decade as hospitals  pushed, with varying levels of success, to offset federal budget cuts  by boosting their income from insurance companies, health executives  say. The resulting wide range of payments for the same services reflects  a healthcare system in which deregulation and lax government oversight  have allowed the hospitals with the most clout to extract big increases  from insurers while everyone else falls behind.</p><p>  "The same service delivered the same way with the same outcome can vary  in cost from one provider to the next by as much as 300 percent," said  Charles Baker, president of the state's second-largest health insurer,  Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. "There is no other sector of the economy  anywhere in this country in which that kind of price variability with no  appreciable difference in service or product quality can sustain itself  over time."</p><p>  Health insurance premiums paid by the average Massachusetts family have  jumped 78 percent since 2000, and Baker believes that a significant  portion of the rise has been driven by hefty insurance payment increases  to dominant providers, who use the extra income to install the latest  technology and expand, often on rivals' turf.</p><p> At the same time, the pay gap undermines less powerful hospitals, whose  officials say that they steadily lose doctors to those that can pay  more, and that they constantly struggle to keep pace with advances in  costly medical technology. For instance, while Mass. General is spending  $686 million on the single most expensive hospital expansion in state  history, the state's second-largest hospital chain, Caritas Christi, had  to borrow money this year to pay for basics, like oxygen tanks.</p><p> "The playing field is dramatically unlevel," said Dr.  John Chessare at a conference in June, when he was acting chief  executive of Caritas Christi. He noted that nearly all Massachusetts  hospitals are nonprofit charities - exempting them from having to pay  millions in taxes - and argued that those  that receive higher insurance  payouts should not be in the business of snaring patients away from the less well paid.</p><p> "They are using that not-for-profit status to make a profit and to build more capacity for things we don't need," he said.</p><p>
<b class="b"> A powerful hand</b>
</p><p> Most patients don't think about the payments  their insurance company makes to hospitals and doctors, but they should:  Inflation of those payments is the main reason insurance premiums  increased by an average of $1,800 per family during this decade. More  than 85 cents of every dollar in insurance premiums goes to pay the  bills in hospitals, doctors' offices, and other medical facilities. Five  years ago, those bills were rising mainly because of growing patient  demand for care, Blue Cross data shows, but now the escalating prices  that hospitals and doctors charge is far more important. A recent  Massachusetts study concludes that the price of inpatient care at  hospitals is rising by 10 percent a year, while overall use of hospital  beds is declining.</p><p> The hospitals that are paid at the highest rates all share one trait:  They have the bargaining clout to demand higher insurance payments.  Often, that clout is based on a powerful brand name and elite  reputation. Children's Hospital has negotiated the highest insurance  payments in the state, arguing that its work with children is uniquely  expensive. The high rates have allowed the hospital to consistently  report profit rates three times the median for Massachusetts hospitals;  still, insurers pay to keep Children's happy because they know parents  won't buy insurance that doesn't include access to one of the world's  most prominent pediatric hospitals.</p><p>  The other source of bargaining power is geographical isolation. Sturdy  Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, for example, commands high insurance  payments for outpatient procedures because local residents have no  convenient alternative, insurance executives say.</p><p>  But no company has thrived more in this sharply competitive world - or  has had more impact on the cost of medicine here - than Partners  HealthCare, a company formed in 1994 to fight back against what its  founders saw as the stinginess and lopsided power of insurance  companies, which had brought many hospitals to their knees. By bringing  together two of the most prestigious hospitals in Boston - the Brigham  and Mass. General - Partners became what some called the "800-pound  gorilla" of Massachusetts healthcare, able to bend insurers to its will.</p><p> Almost from the start, Partners played its powerful hand with  conspicuous - rivals would say relentless - aggression and skill. No  other city can boast two of the top 10 hospitals on US News and World  Report's honor roll, and every insurance company is vividly aware that  its members want access to their famed halls.</p><p> Partners' dominance became clear in 2000, when executives of Tufts  Health Plan had the temerity to refuse Partners' demand for a  substantial rate increase. Partners countered by declaring it would no  longer accept Tufts insurance at its hospitals. Within days, as  thousands of Tufts customers threatened to change insurance rather than  lose the right to treatment at the two famous hospitals, Tufts gave in  to Partners' demands. Since then, Partners has negotiated one big pay  increase after another from insurance companies fearful of a similar  humiliation.</p><p> Today, the Brigham and Mass. General are paid an average of 30 percent  more than similar nonpediatric hospitals statewide for each procedure,  based on payment rates of Blue Cross obtained by the Spotlight Team. The  health official who provided the information asked not to be identified  for fear of professional retaliation. Though Partners' rates are not  the highest - that would be Children's - Partners has more effect on  statewide costs because its revenue is five times larger.</p><p> "We were willing to take the risk of challenging payers," said Partners  chief financial officer Peter Markell, adding that Partners should not  have to apologize for a successful strategy. "If you are never willing  to challenge them, of course they are going to jam it down your throat."</p><p> That willingness to get tough turned Partners' main insurance contracts  from money losers a decade ago to the company's largest source of  profit, Partners officials say. Extrapolating from Partners' internal  tally of its insurance revenues, the Brigham and Mass. General receive  at least $500 million a year more from the three biggest insurers than  if they were paid at the lower rates typical of their rivals. Likewise,  Partners' 6,000 physicians are paid 15 percent to 40 percent more than  most other Massachusetts doctors, based on Blue Cross rates, while the  company's community hospitals earn at least 10 percent more than their  peers.</p><p> Altogether, those higher rates add up to at least $800 million more for  Partners hospitals and doctors than if they were paid at rates similar  to competitors, based on Partners' insurance income. That is the  equivalent of $170 a year for every member of the three leading insurers  - Blue Cross, Tufts, and Harvard Pilgrim.</p><p>  Partners officials reject the idea that their insurance payments have  driven up healthcare costs significantly, arguing that costs in  Massachusetts are part of a national problem and not caused by any one  company. They note that insurance premiums here are rising at about the  same rate as the national average.</p><p> "Boston is experiencing the same premium increases as the rest of the  country," Partners said in a prepared statement to the Globe.</p><p> Likewise, the state's insurers are divided on Partners' responsibility  for the current price run-up. Blue Cross officials discount Partners'  role, while Baker at Harvard Pilgrim says there is a meaningful but  hard-to-measure "Partners effect" on statewide insurance costs. And  Partners officials themselves have said in the past that their goal was  to "reset the prices" paid to hospitals even if it drives up insurance  premiums.</p><p> Partners' favorable insurance contracts have helped the company to reap  $1.7 billion in profits since 2004, reflecting a profit rate that is  average compared with the nationally known hospitals the company  considers its peers. But it's high by Massachusetts standards: Partners  collected 35 percent of statewide hospital profits last year, even  though it owns only 16 percent of the beds.</p><p>  Those earnings have allowed Partners to launch a five-year $4 billion  construction program that includes the addition at least 180 new  hospital beds and several outpatient facilities. Though the current  recession is expected to slow expansion considerably, Partners officials  say it won't affect projects already underway.</p><p> While Partners prospers, 24 Massachusetts hospitals are losing money.  Many of them would be profitable if they had even a fraction of  Partners' contract clout. Caritas Norwood Hospital, for instance, could  erase the $242,347 deficit it reported through the third quarter of this  fiscal year if the hospital were paid Partners rates for the babies it  delivers. Instead, the hospital is losing money and bracing to lose more  next year, when Partners opens a new outpatient center at Gillette  Stadium in Foxborough.</p><p> "Some are able to spend more than others," said Jack Connors, Partners'  longtime chairman of the board. "It's our fortune that we're probably in  the lead on those investments. And several hospitals aren't able to  keep that pace. And that's what I, as a businessman, call market forces,  if you will."</p><p> But market forces don't do much for some other highly regarded  hospitals. A few years ago, when an executive for Beth Israel Deaconess  Medical Center asked then-Tufts HMO boss Harris Berman why Beth Israel, a  Harvard teaching hospital, wasn't paid as well as Partners, Berman said  he had a simple response: "You are not Partners."</p><p> One influential researcher found that Beth Israel's overall mortality  rate was lower in 2005 than the mortality rates at both the Brigham and  Mass. General, but the hospital and its doctors still earn 15 percent to  20 percent less for the same work, according to the Blue Cross rates  obtained by the Globe.</p><p> "Shouldn't there be some correlation between what you get paid for doing  something and the quality of what you do?" asked Beth Israel chief  executive Paul Levy last month in remarks at the Massachusetts Medical  Society.</p><p>
<b class="b"> Curtain of secrecy</b>
</p><p> Michelle Faulkner got lucky.</p><p> The self-employed marketing consultant sprained her right ankle last  Memorial Day weekend for the second time, and in August, when she still  felt pain while running, she went to see an orthopedist. Fortunately for  her, the doctor, affiliated with Winchester Hospital, did not send her  into Boston for an MRI. That choice saved her about $500.</p><p> Faulkner is one of thousands of Massachusetts residents who save money on insurance by purchasing lower-cost plans that require patients  to pay a higher deductible before insurance kicks in. Faulkner had to  pay the $526.84 MRI bill herself, which hurt, but the bill at Winchester  Hospital was far more affordable than what she would have paid for care  at the Brigham ($987) or Mass. General ($1,091), insurance claims data  show.</p><p> "People don't shop around," said Faulkner, 39. "That's why insurance is so high."</p><p> One reason patients don't shop for care is  that, as a practical matter, they can't. The pay rates of different  caregivers have long been treated as confidential data, veiled by  nondisclosure agreements between insurers and hospitals. As a result,  there has been no public notice or debate as an insurance system that a  decade ago paid hospitals and doctors similar amounts for the same work  has grown into one that disproportionately rewards a few.</p><p> The insurance data obtained by the Globe, drawn from millions of medical  claims collected by the state Health Care Quality and Cost Council, is a  byproduct of the state's sweeping healthcare reform law of 2006.  Because some hospitals treat sicker people, the data has been adjusted  to reflect the cost of care for an average patient.</p><p> The law calls for the council to post insurance claim information on the  web so that the public can see the disparities.  But a year and a half  after the law was passed, the council has still not published its  findings because of disputes with medical groups about how the numbers  should be presented and whether they are accurate in every detail.</p><p> "Apparently, this subject is the equivalent of the third rail," said  Gregory W. Sullivan, the state's inspector general and a member of the  Quality and Cost Council.</p><p> However, council officials say privately that the data, after months of  review by the hospitals, is generally accurate. Partners said it has  raised concerns "about the data and methodology" with the council. But  other hospitals contacted by the Globe either confirmed the data's  accuracy or would not comment on it.</p><p> The Globe also checked the state numbers against detailed payment rates  for Blue Cross; the two closely track. The Blue Cross data show that  about 10 hospitals - four Boston teaching hospitals and six community  hospitals - are paid at least 30 percent above the state average, while  12 hospitals make at least 20 percent below average, including Cambridge  Hospital, which earns about half as much per procedure as the Brigham  and Mass. General.</p><p> Partners officials say that they don't know exactly how their pay  compares to others, though they know they are paid more. That added  revenue is going for good purposes, they say, such as research and  doctor training. Insurance profits also subsidize unprofitable lines of  business, such as psychiatric care and the burn units at the Brigham and  Mass. General. In addition, Partners employs 50,000 people, more than  any other private company in Massachusetts.</p><p> Partners officials also say they are building a massive integrated  system that could become a model for how to reduce errors and waste. The  company's computer networks, for example, will eventually be used to  bar-code every single pill, so that each can be double-checked at  bedside.</p><p> "We are different," said Dr. Thomas H. Lee,  chief executive of Partners' physicians network, "I would say it is like  70 percent potential and 30 percent reality in terms of how different.  But we have the pieces of a system that are increasingly actually  working together."</p><p> Lee, however, admits that existing measures of quality do not prove  Partners is consistently better. In fact, he argues that the science of  measuring medical quality remains so limited that it can't determine  which is the best among Massachusetts' very good hospitals.</p><p> He offers an analogy: If the Boston marathon  were judged using tools as  imperfect as current medical quality measures, researchers could  identify the Kenyan runners at the front of the pack, but they could not  predict the winner.</p><p> Partners hospitals, he said, "are running with the pack of Kenyans at  the front of the country. And it's great to be one of those Kenyans, but  there's a fair amount of angst about us because we are being paid more  than the other Kenyans, and they aren't particularly happy about it."</p><p>
<b class="b"> Brand name medicine</b>
</p><p> Karen Dahl, 31, lives less than 2 miles from Mount Auburn Hospital in  Cambridge, but when she became pregnant with her first baby last year,  she decided to go to a Boston teaching hospital to deliver.</p><p> "I talked to women in the area who had babies in Boston," said Dahl, a self-described nervous patient  who gave birth to son Henry by Cesarean section at the Brigham last  November. "I also looked at the US News rankings for female care. The  Brigham was rated very high."</p><p> State health officials have tried to encourage women like Dahl to  reconsider their flight to Boston, pointing out in a 2003 study that  community hospitals are generally just as reliable as teaching hospitals  for normal births. In fact, they had a slightly lower complication rate  - and they're a lot cheaper. Dahl's care cost $8,282.14 at the Brigham,  while the cost at Mount Auburn would have been about $5,700, according  to state insurance data.</p><p> But Dahl, who had a complicated pregnancy, has no regrets: "I felt this was the safest place to be if anything happens."</p><p> Massachusetts patients love brand name medicine, going to teaching hospitals 2.5 times more often than patients  across the country, according to a 2005 report for the Massachusetts  Council of Community Hospitals. It is a habit that carries a heavy cost:  We spend about $1.7 billion more per year than we would using community  hospitals at the national rate.</p><p> Partners' Lee, a cardiologist who still sees patients in addition to his management job, argues that patients are voting with their feet.</p><p> "There's a very fair question of can we afford that as a society, but  there's no question in our market that people want this," Lee said. "I  have people come and see me from New Hampshire and Rhode Island for  their blood pressure, and I tell them, `You don't need to come here,'  and they say, `But I want to,' and I think they're sometimes offended  because I'm trying to chase them away."</p><p> The growing dominance of Partners - and Children's Hospital for  pediatrics - is a microcosm of the national trend in the last 15 years,  as government has increasingly allowed the market to decide what  healthcare will be available and at what price. Hundreds of unprofitable  hospitals closed, while many others merged to gain more negotiating  power with insurance companies, which, by the mid-1990s, were  aggressively denying claims and shortening hospital stays to hold down  costs.</p><p> The balance of power between insurers and providers did need to shift.  But the realignment has had costly side effects: After a decade of  stable insurance rates in the 1990s, medical inflation began to soar  across the country, something economists attributed partly to the  increased clout of merged healthcare systems like Partners. And  healthcare specialists agree that the price run-up did not lead to a  similar improvement in quality.</p><p> At a Federal Trade Commission workshop on healthcare in April, the  moderator asked a panel of healthcare leaders, "Is price a signal of  quality in healthcare markets?"</p><p> A professor quickly offered a one-word answer: "No."</p><p> There was a pause. Then someone else chimed in, "There's a universal no on that."</p><p> The moderator concluded, "That was pretty easy," and moved on to the next question.</p><p>
<b class="b">Behind the rankings</b>
</p><p> To walk the gleaming corridors of Partners' flagship hospitals is to tour a Hippocratic Hall of Fame: Dr. William Morton first demonstrated the use of anesthesia in surgery at Mass. General in 1846. Dr.  Joseph Murray carried out the first successful organ transplant at the  Brigham in 1954. Today, the two hospitals manage one of the largest  biomedical research budgets in the country, carrying out cutting-edge  studies on everything from AIDS to arthritis and attracting patients from all over the world.</p><p> But the high-end procedures that make the Brigham and Mass. General so  famous are not their bread and butter. Eighty-five percent of the time  their doctors are performing the same less glamorous medicine that  occupies most other hospitals: delivering babies, repairing hernias,  treating pneumonia.</p><p> And it is there, in the workaday world of hospital care, that the  hospitals' reputation for unmatched excellence fades - and with it much  of the rationale for the higher payments they receive for such  treatments. The growing, if still inadequate, body of data available  about hospital quality paints a fairly consistent picture of the care at  the Brigham and Mass. General: often good, but rarely extraordinary,  and sometimes inferior to the care available at other hospitals.</p><p> -  The two hospitals have inconsistent performance on routine care,  according to data collected from nearly all US hospitals by the Centers  for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on how often hospitals give the  right drug or test on time. Using a method of comparison commonly  employed by government officials and researchers, the Globe determined  that the two hospitals finished ahead of the other Boston teaching  hospitals overall for four areas of treatment in a recent 12-month  period, but both scored lower on caring for pneumonia patients than half of American hospitals. A quarter of American hospitals outperformed Mass. General on heart failure care.</p><p> -  Hospital accreditors faulted Mass. General after a surprise  inspection in December 2006. They saw staff members fail to wash their  hands after touching patients, and the hospital  could not document that its staff had consistently followed routine  safety checks that can prevent doctors from performing the wrong  procedure on patients. At the Brigham earlier  this year, the rate of one common - but dangerous - infection that  sometimes enters the bloodstreams of intensive care patients was about twice as high as that at Beth Israel Deaconess. Brigham officials said their infection rate has since dropped.</p><p> -  When it comes to saving lives, the Brigham and Mass. General do not  rate the highest even in Massachusetts. A review of 42 individual  mortality ratings produced by the state and federal governments for  Massachusetts hospitals from 2002 to 2007 found that three other  hospitals - Beth Israel Deaconess, Partners' own Newton-Wellesley  Hospital, and Beverly Hospital - had the highest average scores.</p><p> The mortality rankings - adjusted for the relative sickness of patients  at different facilities - graded hospitals as either average, above  average, or below average for ailments and procedures from pneumonia to  coronary bypass surgery. The vast majority of the ratings for all  hospitals were average, but Beth Israel earned a dozen above-average  scores, and none below average. The Brigham received seven above-average  scores and one below-average score. Beverly and Cape Cod hospitals each  earned five top scores and no low scores. Mass. General had four high  scores and one low score.</p><p> In sum: When all scores are averaged, the Brigham ranks high, though not  among the very best; Mass. General was part of the broad middle, or  average, tier.</p><p> Partners officials said some of the ratings are based on untrustworthy  data that should not be used for scoring. In general, they said, the  statistical methods used to adjust for the sickness of the patients at different hospitals are not sophisticated enough to recognize how much more vulnerable their patients are.</p><p> They also noted that even as governments are making more data public,  many of the existing measures are controversial and often fairly crude.</p><p> "I think a consumer that relies on the cross-section of information  that's out there and available to them, it's akin to being a cork  floating in the ocean," said Dr. David F.  Torchiana, head of the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization.  "You'll be driven in random directions by the randomness of the  information that you will obtain."</p><p> But Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who juggles his  practice at the Brigham with writing soul-searching books and  magazine  articles about his craft, said the reality is that no hospital, not  even his own or Mass. General, can be good at everything.</p><p> "We aim to deliver more than 2,000 different kinds of surgical  procedures, and there are more than 10,000 different diagnoses we take  care of," Gawande said of the Brigham and Mass. General. "There is no  way we are the best at all of them. I'd be  surprised if you didn't find that there are particular areas of  incredible excellence, but for the larger share of them we are probably  floating around in the middle, and I would not be surprised if on a  portion of them we are down toward the bottom."</p><p> And it is by no means clear that a big teaching hospital is safer or  better than a well-run community hospital for a wide variety of  procedures, including some that are fairly complex.</p><p> Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, for example, reported no deaths among 741 angioplasty patients  from July 2007 to June 2008, an extraordinary feat that hospital  officials attribute partly to the fact that theirs is not a teaching  hospital. The care also costs less: $20,020 for angioplasty, on average,  compared with $27,242 - 36 percent more - at Mass. General, according  to the insurance records collected by the state.</p><p> "When you go to a teaching hospital you have residents and interns caring for you, which is different from our hospital," said Dr.  Richard Zelman, the hospital's director of interventional cardiology,  referring to doctors who have not completed medical training. "When you  come into Cape Cod Hospital at three in the morning having a heart  attack, you have an attending cardiologist with 20 years of experience  that will take care of the patient every step of the way."</p><p> Many community hospitals say they are willing to cede some of the most  complex, technology-assisted care to the large teaching hospitals. They  can't compete in that arena. And they don't try to.</p><p> But for more ordinary procedures - the vast majority of care - community  hospital officials say the existing data on quality supports what  they've been arguing for years: They're as good. Or better. And  considerably cheaper.</p><p> At Caritas Norwood Hospital, where he scrubbed floors as a teenager, Dr.  Adam Glasgow said it's unfair that the Brigham and Mass. General make  so much more for some procedures, even factoring in the expense of  teaching and research.</p><p> "We're doing the same work," said Glasgow, a surgeon. "It doesn't make  any sense for that institution and that physician to be paid more for  doing the same work. It just drives up the cost of healthcare. It's  unfair, and it's unnecessary."</p><!----><p></p><i></i><!-- inside story_update.jpt -->
