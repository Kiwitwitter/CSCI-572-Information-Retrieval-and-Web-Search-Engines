<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With a team on the young side, the Green Wave will lean on their experienced seniors to start the season. Senior quarterback Jack Maguire returns for a team that reached the Division 4A South semifinals last season. Maguire will have seniors Brian Cashman and Kyle Rogers as returning targets. Coach James Kelliher said senior Ethan Curtin will be among players to watch as a wideout that has developed into a well-rounded talent. Seniors Garrett Porter (guard) and Mike Broomstein (tackle) will help a younger line get adjusted to the next level. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think once they get adjusted, the incoming sophomores will make a mark,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kelliher. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think we can surprise some people. They&rsquo;ll compete and fight every single game.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Coach:</b> Tim Bassett (1st season). Career: 0-0.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 4-7</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Talent at skill positions.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Longtime head coach Bill Maver is out and Tim Bassett is in. It&rsquo;s part of a new era for the Colonials, one they hope builds upon last season&rsquo;s underwhelming 4-7 record. Given the brief amount of time he&rsquo;s had to install new schemes on both offense and defense, Bassett is impressed by where his group is at. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m pretty happy with where the kids are,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;I gave them a playbook at the end of last school year. They learned a lot of the basics on their own and we were able to hit the ground running.&rsquo;&rsquo; The shift from a Wing T offense to the spread may be rocky in the early going, but Bassett was adamant about the change, in part because of junior quarterback Finn Murray. As a sophomore, Murray started every game. Now, he&rsquo;ll have a swath of talent around him including senior running back Kyle Camposano, a perfect fit for the newly installed offense.</p><p>

With the loss of standout quarterback E.J. Perry to graduation (now at BC), Andover&rsquo;s 2017 outlook remains a question mark. Nick Dellatto steps under center to replace Perry at QB. Still, the elder Perry&rsquo;s squad is deep all around. Senior wideout Cedric Gillette was borderline un-coverable in Andover&rsquo;s thrilling 54-48 playoff win over Lexington last season. Junior running back Tommy Duncan will shoulder more of a load than Andover&rsquo;s 2016 running back core due to Perry&rsquo;s graduation.

The Cougars&rsquo; underclassmen did gain invaluable experience during that stretch, which should lend itself to a better 2017. One player targeting a turnaround is senior quarterback Michael Burke. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s just improved leaps and bounds, and he&rsquo;s come back with a lot more confidence this year,&rsquo;&rsquo; said coach Serge Clivio. Seniors Kordell Parrish and Kieran Mullen provide Burke with a pair of quality targets in the passing game. The Cougars also added 6-foot-5, 260-pound tackle Luke Von-Hunnius (6-5, 260), a transfer from St. Clement.

While some of the 2016 roster is gone, the main offensive cog returns: running back Danny Abraham. Already a verbal commit to Harvard, Abraham ran for 385 yards and four touchdowns in last year&rsquo;s season opener against Andover and has an uncanny combination of speed and strength when he gets into space. Defensively, speedy cornerback Bobby DeMeo will match up on opponent&rsquo;s top receivers, the senior a key reason why the Eagles pitched three shutouts in 2016.</p><p>

Golden will have plenty of weapons to plug into his spread attack. Tim Manley and Justin Lopes both took snaps during the preseason. When they aren&rsquo;t running the show they&rsquo;ll see action at receiver or in the backfield. Matt Pauliks is another back/receiver. Senior Alex Govoni is a stopper at linebacker. Bryan Lester and Noah Gagnon anchor both lines.</p><p>

One of the senior leaders ready for an impact season is offensive and defensive lineman Cyril Blair. Junior safety David Robinson and running back Garry Robinson are also poised for big years.

Offensively, junior quarterback Devin Vasquez has picked up Butler&rsquo;s read-option scheme after showing promise in mop-up duty last fall.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Whether it was standout Kerry Raymond in 2015 or Junior Monteiro in 2016, Brockton has suffered an inordinate number of key losses to injury the past two seasons. With the 2017 regular season here, the Boxers&rsquo; current health outlook is far more rosy. Monteiro returns as a senior quarterback poised as the ballcarrier in read-option sets. Mike Norman and Tom O&rsquo;Brien both filled in for Monteiro under center last year and return as viable options running the offense. After starting a handful of sophomores last season, coach Peter Colombo feels more confident his current group can erase last year&rsquo;s disappointing 5-6 mark. &lsquo;&lsquo;Overall, depth and experience (are) our strong suit,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. While the Boxers have yet to hash out who will get the majority of snaps under center, their defense offers a bit more clarity. Junior defensive tackle A.J. Walker leads a formidable line that will continue to stuff opposing running backs. Senior linebacker and running back Dexter Cumberland started for Everett before transferring to Brockton this season. Said Colombo, &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s had some knee issues but when he&rsquo;s healthy he&rsquo;s an impact player and will help our defense a lot.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> A string of rough seasons for the Warriors prompted coach Keith Thomas to shake things up on the offensive end heading into 2017. Brookline plans to operate in a spread offense, a shift from the Wing T it ran in 2016. And what better time to implement a new scheme then with a team full of youth and potential? How the Warriors fare when they have the ball will hinge on junior tailback Amari Withers, the team&rsquo;s primary playmaker. Senior tight end and defensive end Liam Downey will add a dose of experience on the edges for Brookline, which lost eight of its final nine contests in 2016. Said Thomas, &lsquo;&lsquo;We were starting three sophomores at offensive line in (our) first scrimmage. We&rsquo;re going to go through our growing pains but in the end they&rsquo;ll come together and get it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Burke is looking to improve on last season&rsquo;s 5-5 mark. The Bulldogs scored an average of 18 points per game while allowing 20.6 points a season ago. It&rsquo;s not out of the question to think Burke can improve with running back Israel Lara returning for his senior campaign. Defensively, linebacker Rishaad Sheppard will anchor the middle of the field. Cornerback Ernst Clercin will look to solidify the secondary while defensive end Jawon Stone is a force up front. Burke will need to find a new quarterback this season but if they fill that role they could be a dangourous team in the Boston City League South.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With just nine seniors and only seven returning starters, the first season of the Dan MacKay era will be a youth movement. But the Red Devils&rsquo; sophomore class, particularly quarterback Khyle Pena and receivers Jake McCauley and Ryan O&rsquo;Halloran, has MacKay encouraged about the program&rsquo;s future, and even its present. &lsquo;&lsquo;Put it this way, he can make any throw,&rsquo;&rsquo; MacKay said of Pena, who&rsquo;s made some of the most difficult throws look routine. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a very strong arm, he&rsquo;s a very accurate passer. He&rsquo;s already showing that.&rsquo;&rsquo; Pena will get a chance to showcase that promise in an offense that will typically deploy four-receiver sets, led by McCauley, O&rsquo;Halloran, and senior speedster Mike Pavao. When the Devils run, senior captain Cody Davison will look to eat up tough yards inside, while junior Tom DeRosa should be a solid scatback option with his pass-catching ability. Up front, junior bookend tackles Andrew Woods and Tom Splagouinos are healthy again, while guards Johnson Magada and Luke Lord man the interior. Some similar faces dot the front seven on defense, but keep an eye on Sean McGillivray at middle linebacker.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> &lsquo;&lsquo;We knew coming in that we had a ton of starters to replace,&rsquo;&rsquo; said first-year coach Brent Williams of the challenges 2017 will bring, and boy is he right. Still, the Knights should hold their own in the always competitive Catholic Conference. With defensive end Dan Boyle already in tow and Durfee transfer Hunter Salmon a fresh addition to the men in red, CM will be formidable up front. Add in an experienced secondary and the defense figures to be its usual stout self. The question marks come on offense. Though Williams would love to play a smash-mouth style of football, the speed of his roster convinced him to adapt and run the spread.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Central Catholic still has players on its roster who played in the 2015 Division 1 Super Bowl loss to Xaverian. That same group suffered a thumping at the hands of Everett in last year&rsquo;s D1 North semifinal. With a plethora of key returnees, the Raiders hope to make a jump in 2017. Bret Edwards threw 14 touchdown passes in 2016 and returns for his senior season as the leader of coach Chuck Adamopoulos&rsquo;s speedy spread attack. But Adamopoulos says it&rsquo;s senior Mathias Villafane who&rsquo;s due for a breakout season. &lsquo;&lsquo;(Mathias) has been a good player for us right through,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said of the wide receiver and cornerback. &lsquo;&lsquo;We take him for granted a little bit but he&rsquo;s a playmaker on offense and a really good cover kid on defense. He&rsquo;s very consistent.&rsquo;&rsquo; Add senior lineman Ryan Burns and the Raiders are in solid position to retake the Merrimack Valley Conference throne. &lsquo;&lsquo;We did not win the league last year and that is something that haunted us at the end of the season,&rsquo;&rsquo; Adamopoulos said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our first focus is the MVC.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With just one returning starter from last season the Charlestown football team will have a lot of new players on the field come week one. Center Deandre Smith is the lone returner for the Townies. Despite the lack of returners Charlestown is entering the season with experience at quarterback. After transferring from South Boston, Steven Williams is set to make his Charlestown debut under center. Williams is a talented passer and ran a similar spread attack with the Knights last year. The addition of Williams allowed Charlestown to move Quarmise Epps from quarterback to his natural position of receiver, giving Williams a dependable option on the outside.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> In his first year at the helm, coach Dave Kaizer saw vast improvement from August to November. With a number of starters at skill positions returning there is potential for even more improvement this season. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our team goal is to go 1-0 every week, 1-0 every day and 1-0 every play,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kaizer. Sal Lupoli returns as a senior in the backfield and at linebacker for the Lions while senior Jack Slattery and Chris Bungard anchor a strong defensive line. The veteran leadership of Matt Hooton under center could be just the ingredient for a successful year.</p><p>

Running backs Zach Leo and David Bui return to bolster the offensive backfield, but the Red Devils still need to figure out their starting quarterback situation in order to fire on all cylinders.</p><p>

A team of mostly juniors and seniors now includes Noah Froio, an explosive player who can play running back and wide receiver. Splitting carries with him will be senior Michael Nolan. Senior captain Cal Osten returns as a linebacker/fullback. The team will have to incorporate a new QB for the first time in a few seasons. Junior Matt Lund and sophomore Tucker Fulton will compete for the job. &lsquo;&lsquo;We stand a good chance of beating any team week to week,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Afanasiw. &lsquo;&lsquo;The key is being consistent and eliminating mistakes.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Senior RB/DB Colby Holland, a three-time state champion wrestler, looks to bounce back after being hampered by an ankle injury last year. QB Justin Mullany has impressed with his arm this offseason, and has senior TE Zack Dillon as his top target. Said Nolan, &lsquo;&lsquo;Dillon is a strong, smart, physical player on both sides, and is a leader by example.&rsquo;&rsquo; Dillon and RB Tahg Coakley are the Falcons&rsquo; only returning starters.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Indians move down to Division 4 this year, where they will no longer have to deal with high-powered Duxbury or a dangerous North Attleboro team that knocked them out of them state tournament last year. But Richard White ensured his team will face elite competition by scheduling Division 1 powers Central Catholic, Attleboro, and Rhode Island&rsquo;s La Salle Acadmey. Senior Nate Ellis will bring a healthy dose of athleticism to the quarterback position after playing wide receiver last year and Kyle Sullivan anchors a stout defensive line.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Dolphins will return many of their starters from last season, now in their senior year. In particular, four of the five starting offensive lineman will be back -- Sam Kenny, Sawyer McDonald, Brett Halloran, and Mitchell Hayes. The line will protect second-year starting quarterback Jacob McCarthy. Coach Paul Funk says that McCarthy is &lsquo;&lsquo;a smart kid who runs the offense well and is a good leader.&rsquo;&rsquo; In the backfield, seniors Jonah Arsenault and Rob Evans are back from last season and will be vital to the traditional spread offense which Dennis-Yarmouth runs. On defense, the secondary features seniors Brandon Dunn and Daryan Thompson as returning starters. Depth presents a major issue for D-Y as the Dolphins&rsquo; season would take a huge blow if injuries begin to mount.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> For the first time in 36 seasons, Dave Driscoll will not patrol the sidelines for Dighton-Rehoboth. His replacement, however, is no football neophyte, as Dave Moura takes over after 13 years as an assistant at D-R, seven at UMass Dartmouth, and three at his alma mater, Dartmouth High. The Eagles offense will be led by third-year starting quarterback Steven Silvia, who Moura describes as &lsquo;&lsquo;a tremendous leader with a strong arm that runs the ball well and can do pretty much anything we ask of him.&rsquo;&rsquo; When asked about taking over as head coach, Moura added, &lsquo;&lsquo;Dave Driscoll put D-R football on the map and these are big shoes to fill.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After going 8-3 last season, the Bengals could be a top team in the MAC Vocational Large with a roster boasting 18 seniors, including scat back Jacob Swenson, who will return after breaking his leg last season. Head coach Steve Winarski said Swenson will also be a key on defense. Senior quarterback Justin Brodeur takes over under center, with an ability to make adjustments at the line. A senior-laden line will pave the way, including 6-foot-5-inch, 270-pound Andrew Benson. On defense, Winarski expects Benson to have an impact at end with a mix of speed and power. Winarski is looking for his team to win its first game and build on that to go for a second straight league title and get past the second round of the playoffs.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With the amount of MIAA teams running a spread-oriented option attack these days, it&rsquo;s easy to forget that Dracut was one of its foremost pioneers in the Bay State nearly a decade and half ago. From Pat Murphy to Jeff Moore and Jason Houston, every coach has put their own signature on it; Rivers&rsquo;s twist has been a more downhill running approach. And with the 205-pound Allyn French, a scholarship lacrosse prospect with requisite between-the-tackles toughness, Rivers has a great catalyst. On the perimeter, 6-foot targets Nik Carter and Joey Petka could create size mismatches for quarterback Cam McCullough to exploit, clearing runways for 5-foot-5 speedster Nemisis Lopez to do what he does best -- burn. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s very quick, he&rsquo;s got some shake to him, that&rsquo;s for sure,&rsquo;&rsquo; Rivers said. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a playmaker for us, he&rsquo;s pretty good with the ball in his hand.&rsquo;&rsquo; In the trenches, junior Will Peters should be a load on either side of the line, both as McCullough&rsquo;s blind side and an edge-rusher. That should serve a nice compliment to a sound back seven, led by French and Josh Salem at linebacker, Petka and Carter at the safety spots, and Brian Talbot at corner.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Jets return senior running back Brandon Ortega, who figures to be a critical component in an offense that must replace running back Joel Pastrana and quarterback Jeff Benzan. Fellow senior Javier Arruda could be in line for more carries, and junior wideout Kasey Vasquez will give the team an outside threat. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have some holes, our biggest one is we need to find a quarterback,&rsquo;&rsquo; said head coach John Parziale. Parziale said that while finding a quarterback is his team&rsquo;s top priority, he also has some concerns about filling out his offensive line. Seniors David Capone and Anthony Macias will be relied upon to provide veteran leadership in the trenches on both sides of the ball.</p><p>

Junior Liam LeVangie (two TD passes) returns at quarterback and senior co-captain captain Joey Donahue, who scooped up four fumbles, returning two for scores, is back at linebacker. Donahue and fellow captain Eric Duhamel will also team up in the backfield. Classmate Ben Ross will be split out wide and Evan Dyer will also receive playing time for the Vikings.</p><p>

The Hawks return a pair of backs, senior captain Alec Bolstad and junior Manny Alves, both of whom will lead the offense as it breaks in sophomore quarterback Nick Sauvageau. &lsquo;&lsquo;He is a North/South, punishing power back,&rsquo;&rsquo; Connors said of Bolstad. &lsquo;&lsquo;Manny is the same guy, but they&rsquo;re basically a 1-2 punch. You&rsquo;ll see them splitting carries.&rsquo;&rsquo; A veteran front eight should power the Hawks&rsquo; defense, but junior cornerback Hunter Lane will lead what Connors called a &lsquo;&lsquo;talented group, but an inexperienced group&rsquo;&rsquo; in the secondary.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Could Everett possibly be better in 2017 than it was last year, when coach John DiBiaso collected his 11th Super Bowl ring in a dominant win over Xaverian? Doubtful. But the fact that it&rsquo;s a possibility after losing an all-time senior class to graduation should scare the entirety of Division 1. Off to UConn is quarterback Jordan McAfee; in is junior Jake Willcox. Any growing pains Willcox may have should be mitigated by a loaded wide receiver core of Anthony Norcia, Jason Maitre, and Mike Sainristil. The latter doubles as one of the state&rsquo;s best cornerbacks and will be joined in the secondary by safety Lewis Cine, a dynamic junior who has received offers from a host of major FBS schools. Said DiBiaso, &lsquo;&lsquo;The great thing about Lewis is that it&rsquo;s very hard to hit a home run against us because he&rsquo;s back there.&rsquo;&rsquo; Something else to watch for: if all goes according to plan, DiBiaso could procure his 300th career win at Everett come playoff time.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The reigning Division 2A Super Bowl champion is minus nearly all of its starters, on both sides of the ball, from last fall. Graduation claimed the entire offensive line, receivers and starting QB Nick Couhig. However, senior backs Sam Koss and Gates Kelleher return. In the preseason, sophomore quarterback Kyle Connolly has emerged as the front-runner for the starting job. Defensively, Kelleher is a three-year starter at inside linebacker, and in the opinion of coach Derek Almeida, one of the best in the state. Junior Kyle Cardoza is athletic enough to play inside or at defensive end. Expectations are high for Almeida and Co.</p><p>

Leading rusher Anthony Capachietti headlines a group of three backs returning for their senior season. At quarterback, senior Devin Hassett and junior Liam Foley had impressive preseasons. Foley is a pocket quarterback with a strong arm while Hassett presents a mobile threat. Martinelli is considering give both quarterbacks snaps in games, a system the 36-year coach has run before. The offensive line, though, is a question. Though four starters return from last year&rsquo;s unit, the group remains young and still has a lot to prove.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With only three wins in the past two seasons, there&rsquo;s no direction but up for the Flyers in 2017. Says first-year coach Ed Mantie, &lsquo;&lsquo;Any time you take over a brand new football team, you&rsquo;re kind of starting from scratch. There&rsquo;s been a big learning curve but I&rsquo;m very excited with how the kids have bought into what we&rsquo;re doing.&rsquo;&rsquo; Though the system is new, Mantie has plenty of players capable of executing. Framingham will bat around the idea of using two quarterbacks, and the Flyers have at least three running backs who will see time in the backfield. Junior lineman Chidi Nna - a third-down specialist in 2016 - will be a key on both sides of the ball and has an enticing combo of long arms and quick feet. Framingham may struggle slowing opposing pass games, but if their front seven plays to its capability, it may not matter. Said Mantie of his fresh faced group, &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going to do a lot, we&rsquo;re just going to do it really well.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Running an offensive scheme that includes audibles at the line of scrimmage, Noviello will need to be in top form. He&rsquo;ll be aided by a defense that boasts a handful of versatile defensive backs. Juniors Nolan McLaney and Ryan Driscoll started every game as sophomores, the former quarterbacking the defense as a roaming safety. &lsquo;&lsquo;What we look for is versatility,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Bain. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our safeties need to be in the top four (on the team) in tackles and they also need to be terrific in pass defense.

Also in the fold is senior running back Mark Mansfield, who McCarthy calls &lsquo;&lsquo;a very athletic and very strong&rsquo;&rsquo; presence in the backfield. But where skill positions are a strength, the offensive line remains a work in progress. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have a lot of youth and inexperience,&rsquo;&rsquo; McCarthy said of the unit, pointing out that his team had to replace four starters.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After the program&rsquo;s two most successful seasons of the Tony Zerilli era in 2015-16, some may wonder if it&rsquo;s time to temper expectations given the lack of varsity experience (one returning starter) in the trenches. Of course, the Fishermen had just one returning starting lineman on teams that went 9-2 and 8-3 the last two seasons, so this isn&rsquo;t exactly a new dilemma for Zerilli. It&rsquo;ll be tough to replace all-time leading rusher Christian Sanfilippo in the backfield, but quarterback Matt Smith, wingback Marc Smith, tailback Jan Pena-Ortiz, and fullback Ryan Argentino round out the four-pronged rushing attack. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our backfield can actually squat and clean more than our line at this point,&rsquo;&rsquo; Zerilli said. You might see Gloucester throw the ball more this year with a few added ripples to take advantage of the Smith brothers&rsquo; ability in space. Defensively, versatile linebackers Pena-Ortiz and Ollie Emerson lead the way against the run or pass.</p><p>

On offense, quarterback Kyle Vasconcellos graduated, so the Reggies might turn to junior Jose Caceres to fill the void.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The reigning Division 3 state champion Indians graduated 19 of their 22 starters from a year ago, headlined by two-way line stalwart Patrick Flynn, the Globe&rsquo;s D3 Player of the Year now at New Hampshire. But the Indians are embracing a next-man-up mentality when it comes to personnel. The returnees include senior QB Andrew Carroll, who will be working behind a rebuilt offensive line. Defensively, senior linebacker Liam Flynn and end Chris Greene are leaders on and off the field. The core group is comprised of seniors who, as juniors last season, received valuable experience during Hanover&rsquo;s postseason run.</p><p>

But after losing to Everett in the first round of the playoffs, the realization that much of that year&rsquo;s talent would soon be graduating started to set in. Now, Haverhill begins its rebuilding stage. &lsquo;&lsquo;We are starting from the ground up with numerous sophomores at key positions,&rsquo;&rsquo; said O&rsquo;Connor. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a complete overhaul from the bottom up.&rsquo;&rsquo; One such sophomore, Brandon Grundy, will be a key at defensive end, attacking opposing QBs while helping shore up the Hillies run defense.</p><p>

Terres, a three-sport captain, can make plays at both the point of attack and the secondary. Senior Nick Beal provides physicality at TE and MLB.

Up front, junior Scott Elliott is a three-year starter and received an invite to the Army All-American combine. He is receiving interest from D1 college programs. On the perimeter, Holliston has a trio of seniors that are two-way starters: Mikey Nash, Brad Seymour, and Jake Armstrong. At quarterback, senior Ryan Benco, a two-year starter at free safety, takes over for grad Jake Barrett, a former Globe All-Scholastic. Senior Alex Kelley is an anchor at linebacker and is making the transition from the backfield to guard.

Junior Luke D&rsquo;Aloia is back, along with seniors Will Abbott, Mike Ianelli, and Shane Cooney out wide. At tight end, senior captain Matt Lindquist will offer another target for new starting quarterback Ryan Kelleher. Kelleher, a starter towards the end of last season, is a great candidate to run a quick-hitting spread attack considering Girard described the junior signal caller as &lsquo;&lsquo;poised, knowledgeable, and not afraid to use his arm strength.&rsquo;&rsquo; This Hopkinton team should be fun to watch.</p><p>

He&rsquo;s a hurdler for us in track, and he just has the most unbelievable drive,&rsquo;&rsquo; Runner said of Barrios. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a great athlete but he&rsquo;s an even better decision maker. We don&rsquo;t really pass the ball to much but when we do pass he makes me feel good because he&rsquo;s efficient.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Working against them will be the limitations of being a smaller school, with the Hutton citing a turnout of just 30 players this season.

Under center, it&rsquo;s a three-man race with familiar lineage between junior Chris Gally (brother of last year&rsquo;s starter, Drew), senior Danny Doherty, and senior Dewey Millett (brother of Magician greats Bo and Will). Whoever starts will have the luxury of an experienced line and some impressive targets, including 6-foot-6-inch, 250-pound senior tight end Andy Clough, a converted offensive lineman who has picked up Division 1 interest. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a big boy and a gigantic target,&rsquo;&rsquo; coach Jim Rudloff said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard to defend a spread offense moving around someone like Andy.&rsquo;&rsquo; Defensively, the Magicians will be led by Aidan Gillis, who Rudloff calls &lsquo;&lsquo;probably the best middle linebacker in the state.&rsquo;&rsquo; Gillis will receive help from outside linebacker Teddy Mayle, safety Derek Marino, and Will Bosworth off the edge.</p><p>

Experienced senior linemen Adam Caffey and Charlie Femino should ease the process regardless of the signal caller. Track star Rey Guiti should do a number at tailback, while fullback Jack Whitley is chomping at the bit after losing half of his 2016 season to an ACL injury.

Coach Pat Kingman preached attention to detail during camp: if the Sachems do the &lsquo;&lsquo;first thing first,&rsquo;&rsquo; then they should see similar success to their playoff run last year. Harrison LaPierre and Colin O&rsquo;Brien are three-year starters as targets on the outside. Senior end Zach Jordan and junior Brandan Hogan spearhead the defense. Senior Sean McCarthy is an asset on both sides of the ball. Seniors Davis Riendeau and Matt Crowley are weapons at receiver.</p><p>

QB and captain Matt Curran has been praised as &lsquo;&lsquo;a great in-game manager&rsquo;&rsquo; by coach Tony Vizakis. Curran has two big targets in senior WR Kaden Kelly (6-4) and senior TE Tyler Joyce (6-2). Senior captain Patrick Bregoli will start on both lines as a G and DE.

I know it sounds cliche to say, but without any injuries we will go far,&rsquo;&rsquo; coach Dana Olsen said. Although the Mohawks lost three offensive players for the upcoming season, they are relying on their star quarterback Bryce Latosek and running back Kurt Hopkins to lead the team.

Track phenom Smith Charles is back at running back after tallying eight touchdowns on offense, defense, and special teams last year, while senior captain William Crowley and classmate Eddie Hassell lead a dynamic core of receivers. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think we&rsquo;re going to be fine offensively,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Dembowski. &lsquo;&lsquo;Defensively, we have holes to fill at all levels, but we look good and fast.&rsquo;&rsquo; After leading the Wildcats into the tournament in each of his first two seasons, Dembowski&rsquo;s complex and multiple offense should be taking hold in Milton.</p><p>

Junior running back Ngnor Manyang will be replacing much of the production in the backfield. Junior Darian Casseus is another backfield option. Casseus is elusive out of the backfield but can also be a viable passing option. Minuteman averaged just 11.8 points per game last season.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Brandon Perry takes over as head coach of the Sharks this season. The 2002 Old Rochester graduate played running back and defensive back, and played semi-pro in the NEFL. Among the stops for the eight-year coach were Bishop Stang, Upper Cape, and Sturgis as a football and track coach. He inherits a team with 12 seniors already familiar with a run-first system. The coaching staff will also return. &lsquo;&lsquo;The senior class has been very helpful with my transition,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Perry. Key players include senior linebacker/fullback Eli Nickerson. A solid tackler, he&rsquo;ll be making the transition to fullback. Junior quarterback Isaac Hart will step in under center, a mobile pocket-passer that has continued to impress. Perry and his team feel they will be better than the 6-5 record they set as a goal for this season. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s an excitement around the program that we haven&rsquo;t seen in years,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Perry. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to reinforce that they have to work hard and earn it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

After a storied career at Howard High in Maryland, Strunk will look to implement a single wing version of a spread attack and expects sophomore Bobby Joy to play both wing and some quarterback within that scheme. Junior Mac LaBarge will also play quarterback and his older brother, J.P., will solidify the defensive line. With only five seniors on the roster, there could be some growing pains, but Strunk is optimistic about the future of his new program.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Playing in Division 1 is a challenge for Needham, but coach Duffy is up for the challenge. Once an I-formation team, the Rockets will use a spread in 2017 to fit their speedy personnel. Senior captain Charlie Sumner and junior Charlie Ogletree have spent training camp impressing at the QB position, but a starter has yet to be named. Whoever Duffy chooses, they&rsquo;ll be in good hands. Senior captain and three-year starter John Andre returns, his quickness a weapon both out of the backfield and split out wide. With junior Matt Smith also in tow, Needham&rsquo;s passing game could give Bay State rivals headaches. &lsquo;&lsquo;The kids showed up in shape and we&rsquo;re doing well,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Duffy. &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re just in a tough league and a tough division.

Tru Williams is a returning starter under center and Nigel Palmer, off from an impressive 16 touchdown freshman campaign, is back at running back. Barron Hilton makes the move from tailback last season to wide receiver where he will add an extra threat on the outside. Colby McCoy, a 6-foot-4, 265-pound senior transfer, joins senior captain Edgar Semendo as a veteran presence on the squad. Sophomore lineman Eric Dosenburg (6-4, 265) plugs into the middle on both sides of the ball.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> New Mission is entering the season with 11 returning starters. But with most of the returning experience on the defensive side of the ball, the Titans offense will take some time to get up to speed. New Mission will need to find new starters at quarterback, running back, and receiver. Takaki Hobbs looks to replace the production in the backfield while Dradae&rsquo; Montissoi will be a threat on the outside. Andrew Franklin and Tristan Champagne are battling for the starting quarterback position and New Mission coach Michael Pittman-Foreman hasn&rsquo;t ruled out using both quarterbacks depending on the scheme. Champagne is a more traditional quarterback with good arm strength and accuracy while Franklin, a converted running back, is a better athlete. Defensively, New Mission is more sound with six returning starters. Lineman Chris Marks will be the leader on the defensive side of the ball.</p><p>

Senior captains Myles Maloof, Connor Smith and Matt Donlan will pave the way for the Clippers. But challenges remain on offense as they search for a starting quarterback and break in four first-year starters along the offensive line. &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get a guy who can lead there,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smolski said of the quarterback competition between senior Owen Bradbury and junior Thomas Murphy. The signal-callers will be under the tutelage of first-year offensive coordinator Anthony Callahan, who joins the staff from Saugus. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s really energized the offense,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Smolski.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With the graduation of Bryce Adam and the transfer of John Grady to Nobles, the Tigers have plenty of work to do if they want to repeat 2016&rsquo;s successful campaign. It all starts on defense. Senior Nathan Harvey will move from defensive tackle to defensive end so the Tigers can better utilize his speed. Senior Noah Neville - a dynamic, versatile offensive player who coach Mike Coppola said, &lsquo;&lsquo;may be one of the best receivers in the state&rsquo;&rsquo; - will start alongside Will Thompson in what figures to be a sturdy pass defense. Whether Coppola and Co. are able to take the next step hinges on an inexperienced offense. In an attempt to take advantage of their speed and mitigate an offensive line starting three sophomores, the Tigers plan to run more no-huddle in 2017. And with Neville in tow, the thought of a fast-paced spread attack should put fear into the hearts of opponents. Said Coppola of his standout, &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to be our number one guy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Quarterback Kyle Bythrow, a second team All-Cape Ann selection in 2016, is back under center and should be a load to handle with his physicality when the option calls for him to go inside.

But if they&rsquo;re going to battle past the mistakes that are a byproduct of inexperience, the Golden Knights need a group of leaders to rally the team. &lsquo;&lsquo;I have to focus on leadership,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Heres. &lsquo;&lsquo;If we&rsquo;re going to be successful it&rsquo;s going to be because of 11 people, not because of who returned.&rsquo;&rsquo; Despite breaking in new starters at all skill positions, the Golden Knights have the talent to achieve similar offensive production to last season when they averaged 30.5 points per game. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our key is to be very disciplined,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Heres. &lsquo;&lsquo;If they do all that stuff, we have the ability to put points on the board.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

When the Lancers are not punishing foes on the ground, Kearsley will be the primary target in the air.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Patriots are in the midst of a youth movement after two high-watermark seasons for the program, but there&rsquo;s a lot to be encouraged about on either side of the ball. Coach Lou Cicatelli hopes he can build around his &lsquo;&lsquo;Mr. Everything&rsquo;&rsquo;, 5-foot-10-inch, 165-pound Badr Haou, who led the team in touchdowns a year ago and has played everywhere from X receiver to tight end to wingback and even won two games with his kicking ability. &lsquo;&lsquo;Badr&rsquo;s not the fastest kid in the world but he has some of the greatest hands,&rsquo;&rsquo; Cicatelli said. Juniors Frank Sims and Devin Mathias anchor the middle of the offensive and defensive lines, while Ryan Mangino and Edeh Ballo will also contribute in the trenches. &lsquo;&lsquo;These kids are physical,&rsquo;&rsquo; Cicatelli added. &lsquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re all strong, hungry kids.&rsquo;&rsquo; Under center, sophomore Jonathan Murphy shows a lot of upside with his athleticism and 6-foot-1-inch frame, and we may see him on a number of sprint-out plays this season.</p><p>

A 1995 Rockland grad who won a state title with the program in 1992, Nick Liquori is the head baseball coach as well. Jon Baar, who broke his wrist in the first game of last season, takes over at QB. Conner Shea, who tore his ACL during training camp last year, will start at running back and linebacker. Those two captains lead a 12-player senior class that is determined to make the playoffs. Classmates Zach Sharland (TE/DE), Will Brenmore (MLB/OL) and Lou Casey (T/DT) headline a group ready to win.</p><p>

This season the Fightin&rsquo; Saints are looking to continue improving, but with just five returning starters they&rsquo;ll have a lot of inexperienced players on the field. One area Sacred Heart is strong at is the offensive line, where three starters return, including senior captain Tyler Potrykus.

Seven sophomores will start on offense, including three of the four wideouts. Nalen feels he can depend on the underclassmen, though. &lsquo;&lsquo;Two of them were starters for 11 games as freshmen, so they&rsquo;re young but they&rsquo;re experienced,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s definitely one of our strengths, our receivers, but they&rsquo;re young.&rsquo;&rsquo; Senior captain Ricky Martinez is the only veteran wide receiver and plays in the middle of the defense at Mike linebacker. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think our linebackers are a strong part of our defense,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Nalen, who noted the two sophomores alongside Martinez stood out in the preseason.</p><p>

But who replaces Peter Churchill (29 TD passes), now a freshman QB at St. Lawrence University? Two juniors, Aidan Sullivan and Jack Ruble, entered camp vying for the starting position. Each has showcased a strong arm and sharp pocket awareness in the preseason. Senior receiver Abel Lopes, who led Division 2A in touchdown receptions (12) last season, is a top target and classmate Peyton Crosby is set to be a major weapon on offense, defense, and special teams. He put his speed on display at free safety last season and returned three kickoffs for scores. Injuries have been an issue on a thin O line.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Power back Matt Heaney and the majority of his O line from last year&rsquo;s 8-3 squad that charged to the Division 4 South final has graduated. Yet coach Vernon Crawford is confident that Seekonk can make another run. &lsquo;&lsquo;We just have to be real good at doing what we do -- being fast and keeping [foes] off guard,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the coach. Directing a no-huddle spread attack that wears teams down, senior Terry Smith is back at QB. Classmate Shane Smith is a two-way standout at receiver and free safety. Just 5-foot-3, 155 pounds, senior Brian Dias wrecks havoc at nose tackle. The goal remains the same, according to Crawford: win the South Coast Conference.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> A strong front seven will once again be key for the Eagles. Coming off their first winning season since their Super Bowl victory in 2012, coach Dave Morse&rsquo;s squad must now account for the loss of a strong senior class. Senior Jake Romanow and junior Coleman Loftus are veteran linebackers and captains that will lead a relatively young defense. The team suffers from a lack of height; just six players on the roster are listed at 6-0 or taller.</p><p>

Baker, who registered 395 yards rushing, 127 yards receiving and six touchdowns in 2016, can also play quarterback in the wildcat. He also serves as one of three leaders on the defense, a group that includes defensive end Chris Lucas (79 tackles, 3 sacks in 2016) and linebacker Mark Companeschi, who led the team with 100 tackles last fall. Longtime coach Al Costabile believes the Rams need to hit the ground running. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have a lot of inexperience, and I think a real key for us is to get off to a fast start,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p><p>

Somerset-Berkley returns several starters from last year&rsquo;s team, now in their junior season. Top lineman Ben McMahon excelled on both sides of the ball last season while junior running back Mike Gagliardi will carry much of the load in the backfield after being utilized mainly in third down situations a year ago.

South Boston&rsquo;s offense returns six starters but will have big holes to fill, including at quarterback. With a small roster, coach Germaine Sattiewhite has elected to push his players mentally rather than physically this preseason in an effort to reduce injuries.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> If the Spartans sustain their success on defense -- they yielded just 12.7 points per game last season -- it will be largely due to the work of defensive coordinator John Rafferty. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s simply outstanding,&rsquo;&rsquo; said coach Bob Almeida. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s the best drill person. The way he conducts his defensive sessions are second to none, and the kids have bought in wholeheartedly to what we teach.&rsquo;&rsquo; The Spartans did suffer a major loss with the graduation of standout linebacker Tim Russell, but Almeida remains confident in his replacements. Senior Tre Pignone moves from quarterback into the backfield, where the standout athlete can contribute in a variety of ways. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s such a threat running the ball that we felt it was best to put him at the wing position, where he can run and receive passes,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Almeida. The Spartans shouldn&rsquo;t skip a beat at quarterback with senior Jack McCabe taking the reins. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a leader, number one. He&rsquo;s intelligent,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Almeida. &lsquo;&lsquo;His mechanics are very good, his ball-handling skills are good, and he&rsquo;s an athlete.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Give Leonard time in the pocket and he&rsquo;ll make you pay. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be a new team,&rsquo;&rsquo; Sidwell said. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have quite a few inexperienced players (but) they&rsquo;re talented and excited.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After a 41-12 loss to Abington in the Division 4A South quarterfinals last year, coach Bill Panos hopes to see his Warriors advance further in the postseason this season. &lsquo;&lsquo;I hope to get into the playoffs,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have been in the playoffs the last couple of years but I hope to win that first game which has been avoiding us.&rsquo;&rsquo; Panos expects big things from sophomore Matt Lavoie, who will replace his graduated brother Justin Lavoie at quarterback.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With seven returning starters on each side of the ball, West Roxbury is entering the season with a good amount of experience. One position that will need to be filled is quarterback. Erven Exhilhomme is the favorite to land the starting job after filling in at times last season. Michael Cruz will be back for the Raiders at running back along with Louis Pina. The offensive line is a cause for concern entering the season as West Roxbury graduated three starters from last year. Derek Bertucci will be the leader on this year&rsquo;s unit. After a 3-8 season, coach Derek Wright&rsquo;s biggest goal for this fall is to just improve week to week. &lsquo;&lsquo;As far as expectations, I just look for them to improve each week,&rsquo;&rsquo; Wright said. &lsquo;&lsquo;As long as they continue to improve I&rsquo;d be happy with that.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> &lsquo;&lsquo;The kids are fired up. Everything is positive and everything is going well,&rsquo;&rsquo; said first-year coach Pat Gendron, who has a talented group of seniors who have stepped forward to lead the younger players in camp. Receiver Tyler Blagg is a threat on the outside with junior Cam Barisano at QB. Richard Haggerty and Scott Beattie anchor the defensive backfield, and John Sturrock is stout at the line of scrimmage.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After spending five years as an assistant on the Wildcat staff, Rich Brissette returns this time as head coach -- a title he previously held from 2001-05 after a 10-year run at Hudson Catholic. Playing an independent schedule instead of the Dual County Small, the Wildcats usher a new five-man rotation into the backfield, a group that includes seniors Theo DelGizzi, Mike Sacco and Andrew Black, and juniors Julian Antoine and Junior Uga. There&rsquo;s some uncertainty along the offensive line, though, which welcomes five new starters. Brissette will count on offensive lineman/linebacker Hayden Zeller and cornerback/wide receiver Cade Rutkowski -- both sophomores -- to deliver if the Wildcats are to improve last season&rsquo;s 3-7 record. The Wildcats are also uncertain of the location of their home games through Nov. 1, which is when the school expects the installation of artificial turf to be complete.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The offensive coordinator at Westwood for 11 years, Brad Pindel returns to the sidelines for the Wolverines after a three-year stint as head coach of Dover-Sherborn. Senior quarterback Reed Wilson will captain Pindel&rsquo;s spread offense and often look towards top target Jake Antonucci. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going to be good to have a veteran under center and a receiver who is an incredible athlete,&rsquo;&rsquo; Pindel said. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our passing game should be our strength.&rsquo;&rsquo; Solidifying Westwood&rsquo;s offensive and defensive line is 6-foot-4-inch, 330-pound senior Colin Best, while kicker Nick McQuarry, a transfer from Florida, should give the Wolverines a leg up on special teams.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After taking a step forward with a 4-7 season in 2015, the Wildcats took a step back with a 2-9 2016 campaign. Evan Couper will be back under center for the Wildcats, who will also return multiple linemen. It&rsquo;ll be important to find success on the road this season after going 1-4 last season away from Weymouth.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With nine starters returning on offense and six returning on defense, the Panthers look to build on their second straight 7-4 season. The offense will be led by QB Ethan Phelps, who took an inexperienced 2016 squad to the MIAA tournament. Top receivers Bobby McCormack and Jason Bossen graduated, leaving Phelps with young but talented targets. Senior center and Patriot League All-Star Riley Holland will anchor the offensive line. Said coach Mike Driscoll, &lsquo;&lsquo;We expect to compete for a championship.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After back-to-back 3-8 seasons, the Wildcats are determined to return to their winning ways with an athletic squad. Coach Kevin Bradley touted the leadership of seniors John Rose (OL/DL), Carvea Chen (WR/DB), Andrew Buzzell (LB), along with his son, Kevin Bradley (QB), all of whom are returning starters. &lsquo;&lsquo;A lot has to do with leadership,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the elder Bradley. &lsquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the key. We&rsquo;ve got that senior leadership and we can make some noise.&rsquo;&rsquo; The Wildcats hope the addition of defensive coordinator Lance Little boosts a defense in which Bradley sees growth from last fall. &lsquo;&lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t have linebackers last year that could make the hit behind the line of scrimmage, and I think we have that this year,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;They were young last year and they&rsquo;ve grown over this year, so we&rsquo;re hoping they step up.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Of all the coaching changes in the offseason, one of the sneaky best hires was Craig Turner, who built an infantile Mystic Valley program into one that competed for sectional titles and churned out Division I talent by the end of its first decade of existence. The Wildcats already seem to be enjoying the sea change under Turner, who&rsquo;s up for the tall task of installing his patented spread scheme in a program that had been more conservative offensively in recent years. Quarterback Graham Smith, a Franklin Pierce baseball commit who missed last season with a collarbone injury, has picked up the offense quickly and his dual-threat ability could mean success for the Wildcats. On the perimeter, Tyler Roberts moves from tight end to wideout and Turner expects him to &lsquo;&lsquo;open some eyes this year&rsquo;&rsquo; with his physicality in the vertical passing game. Defensively, Roberts could be a real threat at outside linebacker in the Wildcats 3-4 front, and should hardly leave the field with his pass rush and pass coverage abilities.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Five of the Sachems seven losses were by seven points or less last year. Senior captain Liam Fitzpatrick will start at QB for the fourth season after throwing for 1,700 yards and 18 touchdowns last season. His main target will be fellow captain Steve Osborne, a senior and three-year starter at WR. Seven other seniors will return as starters. Said coach Wally Dembowski; &lsquo;&lsquo;If we can finish games stronger and continually improve on a weekly basis we should be competitive in every game.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Winthrop hasn&rsquo;t played a down of football and already faces a disadvantage: it expects to be without a home field until the Thanksgiving Day game against Revere -- that&rsquo;s when construction on its artificial turf should wrap up. It&rsquo;s a point of frustration for coach Sean Driscoll, whose roster includes only six seniors. &lsquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re going to have to mature fast,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. This season should serve as valuable experience for Winthrop&rsquo;s 27 freshmen and sophomores, but some obstacles can be expected early in the year. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s like a total rehab after coming off a lousy year last year,&rsquo;&rsquo; Driscoll said. &lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s definitely a rebuilding year.&rsquo;&rsquo; Winthrop receives a boost up front from two-way lineman Calvin Tufa, a three-year starter Driscoll calls &lsquo;&lsquo;my best all-around player.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

We are looking to compete for the league title every year.&rsquo;&rsquo; Belcher will have a large number of talented seniors at his disposal in his first year. Eli Ibrahimi, Ryan Getherall, Nelson Claude, Dustin Burkle and Bishop Fenwick transfer Isaiah Cashwell-Doe will be a fun group to watch on both sides of the ball.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After losing to Everett in last year&rsquo;s Division 1 Super Bowl, 24-year veteran head coach Charlie Stevenson decided to call it quits. Now the Hawks turn to former defensive coordinator Al Fornaro to lead them after losing key contributors Devon Piccinin, Cal Flanders, and Mekhi Henderson to graduation. There&rsquo;s still plenty of talent to go around. Senior safety Brian Abraham, who the Hawks plan to use off the edge and in blitz packages in addition to traditional pass coverage, has already received a verbal commitment from Yale. Senior running back and cornerback Ike Irabor shined in a limited role late in 2016. Says Fornaro, &lsquo;&lsquo;Even though (Ike) is 5-10, we don&rsquo;t have any reservations lining him up on a 6-3 guy. We&rsquo;ll match him up on the opponent&rsquo;s best receiver.&rsquo;&rsquo; Though the Hawks have been known for their strong running attack in previous seasons, Fornaro plans to run a more balanced offensive scheme.</p><p>
