<b class="b">Jaguars 30, Steelers 9 </b>&mdash; Telvin Smith and Barry Church returned a pair of Ben Roethlisberger&rsquo;s interceptions for touchdowns and visiting Jacksonville (3-2) stunned Pittsburgh (3-2).</p><p>The Jaguars beat the Steelers for the first time in a decade by relying heavily on the NFL&rsquo;s top-ranked pass defense. The Jaguars picked Roethlisberger off five times and sacked him twice. Leonard Fournette ran for 181 yards and two touchdowns for the Jaguars, who are over .500 after five games for the first time since 2010 and have already matched their win total from 2016.</p><p class="noprint">&lsquo;&lsquo;I think this is a completely different ballclub compared to last year,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Jaguars safety Tashaun Gipson, who had two of Jacksonville&rsquo;s five interceptions. &lsquo;&lsquo;We got guys who will make plays on the football, guys in situations to make plays, and that&rsquo;s all you can ask for. This year has been fun so far.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p class="noprint">&lsquo;&lsquo;Maybe I don&rsquo;t have it anymore,&rsquo;&rsquo; Roethlisberger said, who was picked off a caree-high five times.</p><p>Roethlisberger was picked off a career-high five times. No Steelers quarterback had thrown it to the other team five times in a game since Mark Malone did it against Cleveland 30 years ago.</p><p class="noprint">A week after a sideline outburst generated headlines and drew Roethlisberger&rsquo;s ire, Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown caught 10 passes for 157 yards.</p><p class="noprint">Brown was also the intended receiver on a pair of third-quarter passes the opportunistic Jaguars turned into points. The Steelers led, 9-7, when Roethlisberger looked left for Brown. Jacksonville defensive lineman Abry Jones tipped it into the hands of Smith, who chugged 28 yards to put Jacksonville in front with 6:38 left in the period.</p><p class="noprint">The Jaguars defense struck again on Pittsburgh&rsquo;s next series. Roethlisberger tried to hit Brown down the sideline. Jalen Ramsey deflected it and Church came down with it. A 51-yard sprint later and Jacksonville had turned a 2-point deficit into an 11-point lead without taking an offensive snap.</p><p class="noprint">When Tashaun Gipson made a leaping pick near the Jacksonville goal line in the final minutes to thwart any chance of a Pittsburgh rally, it gave the Jaguars 15 takeaways on the season. They managed an NFL-low 13 while going 3-13 in 2016.</p><p class="noprint">Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles passed for just 95 yards and a pick, but the way Fournette ran the ball and the defense pushed the Steelers around, it hardly mattered.</p><p></p><div class="wide">

<b class="b">Jets 17, Browns 14 </b>&mdash; Josh McCown threw two touchdown passes and visiting New York (3-2) beat Cleveland (0-5), which benched rookie quarterback DeShone Kizer and fell to 1-20 under coach Hue Jackson.</p><p class="noprint">McCown went just 1-10 in two seasons as a starter for the Browns, who released him on Feb. 7 in a cost-cutting move. The 38-year-old wasn&rsquo;t seeking revenge, but he got it with two second-half scoring tosses.</p><p>McCown threw a 2-yard TD pass to Austin Seferian-Jenkins in the third quarter and a 24-yarder to Jermaine Kearse in the fourth. </p><p class="noprint">Kearse&rsquo;s TD capped a 97-yard drive after Jackson decided not to try a potential tying field goal &mdash; rookie kicker Zane Gonzalez missed two attempts in the first half &mdash; and went for it on fourth down. However, running back Isaiah Crowell was stopped short by New York&rsquo;s defense.</p><p class="noprint">Jackson also decided to replace Kizer in the second half for backup Kevin Hogan, perhaps a sign the coach is worried about losing his job. Hogan threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end David Njoku.</p><p class="noprint">&lsquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was going in the right direction,&rsquo;&rsquo; Jackson said of Kizer&rsquo;s benching. &lsquo;&lsquo;That is why I made the decision to take him out. We go into every game trying to win. That is our goal. That is our job. That is my job. I&rsquo;m not here just to get players better. That is part of it, but it is also to win. I think if there is a decision that needs to be made to win, that is the decision I am going to make.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p class="noprint">Kizer was understandably upset following the game.</p><p class="noprint">&lsquo;&lsquo;Frustrated for sure,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the second-round pick, who has nine interceptions and a league-low 49.5 rating. &lsquo;&lsquo;This is all new to me. Being 0-5 is new to me. This organization and this city deserves wins.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>
<b class="b">Bengals 20, Bills 16 </b>&mdash; A.J. Green had a hand in three turnovers that kept it close, but the receiver also pulled off a 77-yard touchdown and another long catch that set up a score, rallying Cincinnati (2-3) over visiting Buffalo (3-2).</p><p>After losing their first three games, the Bengals have salvaged their season by getting the ball to their playmakers at decisive moments. Green&rsquo;s 47-yard catch set up a 5-yard touchdown run by Joe Mixon that put Cincinnati ahead to stay in the fourth quarter.</p><p class="noprint">The Bills got off to an encouraging start by relying heavily on kicker Stephen Hauschka and a defense that led the league, allowing only 13.5 points per game in the first four. The combination wasn&rsquo;t enough this time. Buffalo&rsquo;s depleted offense couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of Cincinnati&rsquo;s three turnovers.</p><p class="noprint">Tyrod Taylor&rsquo;s off-target pass was picked off near midfield with 2:14 left, clinching it for Cincinnati. Taylor finished 20 of 37 for 166 yards and was sacked six times.</p><p class="noprint">The Bengals changed offensive coordinators after failing to get a touchdown in their first two games. Green complained that they weren&rsquo;t getting the ball to their difference makers. He made the difference Sunday, catching seven passes for 189 yards.</p><p class="noprint">He ran past rookie cornerback Tre&rsquo;Davious White and caught Andy Dalton&rsquo;s pass in stride for a 77-yard score on the Bengals&rsquo; second possession.</p><p class="noprint">Green also had a hand in the Bengals&rsquo; three turnovers that kept the Bills in it. Green had passes go off his hands and his chest for a pair of interceptions. He also fumbled after a catch.</p><p class="noprint">Dalton twisted his left ankle in the first half and finished the game with a limp, getting it heavily taped at halftime. He was 22 of 36 for a season-high 328 yards.</p><p class="noprint">The Bills got little out of an offense down to four healthy receivers because of injuries, managing only 221 yards. They&rsquo;ve been held under 300 yards in each of their last four games.</p><p>
<b class="b">Dolphins 16, Titans 10 </b>&mdash; Jay Cutler finally silenced the boobirds with a fourth-quarter TD pass, and host Miami (2-2) overcame another dismal offensive showing to beat Tennessee (2-3).</p><p>The jeers started in the first quarter of the Dolphins&rsquo; home debut and soon the crowd was chanting for backup quarterback Matt Moore. But coach Adam Gase stuck with Cutler, who capped a 58-yard drive with a 6-yard TD pass to Jarvis Landry. </p><p class="noprint">Gase noted the crowd also lobbied unsuccessfully for Moore during a victory over Tennessee last year, when Ryan Tannehill was the struggling starter.</p><p class="noprint">&lsquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rsquo;&rsquo; Gase said. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make the decision about the quarterback. We&rsquo;re not going to take public polls.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>The Titans played without quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was inactive because of a left hamstring injury suffered a week ago. </p><p class="noprint">Replacement Matt Cassel went 21 for 32 for 141 yards and was sacked six times.</p><p class="noprint">Cutler went 12 for 26 for just 92 yards, but the Dolphins improved to 2-2 while the Titans fell to 2-3. Miami came in ranked last in the NFL in points and yards per game, and struggled against a Titans team that allowed 57 points against Houston a week ago.</p><p class="noprint">Miami&rsquo;s only TD in the first three periods was scored by safety Reshad Jones on a 38-yard fumble return when the other players on both teams apparently thought the play had ended with an incomplete pass. The Titans didn&rsquo;t chase Jones, and the officials didn&rsquo;t initially signal a score.</p><p class="noprint">The Dolphins won despite totaling just 178 yards. They tried the wildcat in the second quarter, and even that flopped &mdash; tight end MarQueis Gray took the snap, faked a handoff and threw incomplete.</p><p>
<b class="b">Chargers 27, Giants 22 </b>&mdash; Philip Rivers threw a 10-yard TD pass to Melvin Gordon with 2:58 to play and visiting Los Angeles (1-4) rallied to beat New York (0-5) to end a nine-game losing streak.</p><p>&emsp;The touchdown pass was Rivers&rsquo;s third of the game and came four plays after Odell Beckham Jr. suffered a severe ankle injury and became the fourth Giants receiver knocked out of the game.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Rivers also hit Gordon on a 6-yard TD pass in the second quarter and had a 25-yarder to tight end Hunter Henry in the third as the Chargers ended a nine-game losing streak dating to late November.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Manning had given the Giants a 22-17 lead early in the fourth quarter with a 48-yard TD pass to a wide-open Beckham. New York missed the 2-point conversion attempt after being hit with a delay of game penalty.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Manning, who was sacked five times, also threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to backup Roger Lewis Jr. in the third quarter. Orleans Darkwa scored on a 23-yard run and the Giants got a safety in scoring their first first-quarter points this season.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Giants receivers Sterling Shepard and Brandon Marshall also left the game on the same second-quarter series with sprained left ankles. A third receiver, Dwayne Harris, broke a foot on a kickoff return in the third quarter. </p><p></p><div class="wide">

<b class="b">Panthers 27, Lions 24 </b>&mdash; Cam Newton threw three touchdown passes and visiting Carolina (4-1) held off Detroit (3-2).</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;The Panthers scored 24 straight points after trailing the Lions 10-3 early in the second quarter. Detroit rallied, but could not stop Newton on his last drive to get the ball back. Newton came under fire for making sexist comments to a female reporter this week. He apologized after losing an endorsement deal and getting criticized by the NFL.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;He was 26 of 33 for a season-high 335 yards. On perhaps the game&rsquo;s key play, he converted a third-and-19 from the Carolina 24 with a sharp, 17-yard pass to Kelvin Benjamin with two minutes  left while clinging to a 3-point lead against a team out of timeouts.</p><p>
<b class="b">Seahawks 16, Rams 10 </b>&mdash; Russell Wilson passed for 198 yards and a TD, and Earl Thomas forced two of the Rams&rsquo; five turnovers as Seattle (3-2) rode its defense to a win at Los Angeles (3-2).</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Jimmy Graham scored late in the first half in a defense-dominated win for the Seahawks (3-2), who shut out the NFL&rsquo;s highest-scoring offense in the second half of their second straight win over their NFC West rivals.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Thomas made enormous defensive plays early and late for Seattle. The veteran safety stripped the ball from Todd Gurley at the goal line to kill the Rams&rsquo; opening drive, and he intercepted Jared Goff&rsquo;s fluttering pass at midfield with 6:02 to play.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Sheldon Richardson also came through with two big plays, diving to intercept a deflected pass in the third quarter before scooping up Goff&rsquo;s fumble near midfield with 2:45 left.</p><p>
<b class="b">Eagles 34, Cardinals 7 </b>&mdash; Carson Wentz threw a career-best four touchdown passes and host Philadelphia (4-1) continued its impressive start with a rout of Arizona (2-3). </p><p class="noprint">Wentz tossed three scoring passes in the first quarter, including 59 yards to Torrey Smith, 11 yards to Zach Ertz, and 15 yards to Trey Burton. He connected with Nelson Agholor for a 72-yard TD in the third quarter that left six-time Pro Bowl cornerback Patrick Peterson shouting on the sideline.</p><p class="noprint">Carson Palmer and Arizona&rsquo;s one-dimensional offense were held to 279 yards. The Cardinals have alternated losses and wins since Week 1.</p><p class="noprint">Wentz torched a secondary that features Peterson and Tyrann Mathieu, finishing 21 of 30 for 304 yards. Peterson held Alshon Jeffery to three catches for 31 yards, but Wentz spread the ball around.</p><p>
<b class="b">Ravens 30, Raiders 17 </b>&mdash; Joe Flacco hit Mike Wallace on two deep passes to spark Baltimore&rsquo;s struggling offense, and the visiting Ravens (3-2) got a fumble return for a touchdown by Jimmy Smith to beat Oakland (2-3).</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Flacco had struggled to get the ball downfield in losing the past two weeks. He changed that on the opening drive of the game for the Ravens when he connected on a 52-yard pass to Wallace that set up an early touchdown and established the tone for the day.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;The Raiders, playing without injured star quarterback Derek Carr and two key cornerbacks, played from behind all game as Smith returned Jared Cook&rsquo;s fumble 47 yards for a touchdown that made it 14-0 just 3:50 in.</p><p class="noprint">&emsp;Backup quarterback E.J. Manuel, making his fourth start in the past three seasons, threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree and led another TD drive that ended in Marshawn Lynch&rsquo;s 3-yard run. He finished 13 for 26 for 159 yards.</p><p>
<b class="b">Colts 26, 49ers 23 </b>&mdash; After blowing a 14-point lead in the final eight minutes of regulation and surviving an interception in overtime, Marlon Mack&rsquo;s 35-yard run set up Adam Vinatieri for a 51-yard field goal as host Indianapolis (2-3) beat San Francisco (0-5) on a day the Colts retired Peyton Manning&rsquo;s No. 18.</p><p class="noprint">Vinatieri made four field goals to move into second on the NFL&rsquo;s career list, one ahead of Gary Anderson (538). Mack and Jacoby Brissett each scored on TD runs for the Colts (2-3), who have won both games against winless teams.</p><p class="noprint">San Francisco is one of three teams that still has not won this season. The Browns and Giants are the others.</p><div class="wide">
