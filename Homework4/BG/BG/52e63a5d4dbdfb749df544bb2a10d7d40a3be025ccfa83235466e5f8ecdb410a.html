<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Bengals averaged 32.2 points per game in 2016 and, unfortunately for opposing defenses, head coach Randolph Abraham will return most of his offensive firepower. Seniors William Jean, Jerrod Clark, and Erick Brown combined for 36 touchdowns from the skill positions, and junior quarterback Patrick Bynoe has secured the starting quarterback spot. Abraham said his defense is a well-tested unit, with four returning starters. He said the offensive line is a potential area of concern, but added that the young group is eager to prove themselves.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 6:30 p.m., vs. North Reading</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Chelsea</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Jack Halas (3rd season). Career: Record: 6-16.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 4-8</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Offensive and defensive lines</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Finding a quarterback</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Looking to improve on last year&rsquo;s 4-8 record, coach Jack Halas feels his team is well prepared to win the battle in the trenches this season. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our offensive and defensive lines are pretty good,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re young, but they&rsquo;re good.&rsquo;&rsquo; He also says he has faith in his front seven; his team will play a base 4-3, and senior defensive linemen Ronnie Buford and Rafael Reyes will be important in that scheme. Running backs Zach Leo and David Bui return to bolster the offensive backfield, but the Red Devils still need to figure out their starting quarterback situation in order to fire on all cylinders.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Saturday, Sept. 16, 10:30 a.m., at Northeast</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">East Boston</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> John Parziale (8th season). Career: Career: 42-32.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 5-6</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Depth</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Finding a quarterback</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Multiple</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The Jets return senior running back Brandon Ortega, who figures to be a critical component in an offense that must replace running back Joel Pastrana and quarterback Jeff Benzan. Fellow senior Javier Arruda could be in line for more carries, and junior wideout Kasey Vasquez will give the team an outside threat. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have some holes, our biggest one is we need to find a quarterback,&rsquo;&rsquo; said head coach John Parziale. Parziale said that while finding a quarterback is his team&rsquo;s top priority, he also has some concerns about filling out his offensive line. Seniors David Capone and Anthony Macias will be relied upon to provide veteran leadership in the trenches on both sides of the ball.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 6 p.m., at New Mission</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Georgetown</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Eric McCarthy (3rd season). Career: Career: 7-14.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 6-4</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Skill positions</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Young offensive line</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Multiple</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Coach Eric McCarthy has the Royals poised for success this season. Senior quarterback Tommy Long is back to lead the offense and his receiving corps features classmate Jimmy Sherman and talented junior Hunter Lane. Also in the fold is senior running back Mark Mansfield, who McCarthy calls &lsquo;&lsquo;a very athletic and very strong&rsquo;&rsquo; presence in the backfield. But where skill positions are a strength, the offensive line remains a work in progress. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have a lot of youth and inexperience,&rsquo;&rsquo; McCarthy said of the unit, pointing out that his team had to replace four starters. But McCarthy feels good about his offense as a whole and believes his team will be strong. &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re looking to take the next step as a program,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 7 p.m., vs. Tech Boston</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Greater Lawrence</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Tony Sarkis (12th season). Career: Career: 85-57.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 7-4</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Offensive continuity</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Youth</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Greater Lawrence returns three fifths of its starting offensive line in juniors Giovanni Covino, Michelette Vargas and senior Malib Pastrana, a CAC all-star last season. Another key will be fellow senior all-star David White, who will be shooting through gaps on both sides of the ball as a running back and linebacker. On offense, quarterback Kyle Vasconcellos graduated, so the Reggies might turn to junior Jose Caceres to fill the void. With just six returning starters overall, coach Tony Sarkis will have to plug any holes with new blood, particularly on the defensive side of the ball.</p><p>

Aiding that effort will be an offensive line featuring five players with varsity starting experience, including Patrick Canney and Owen Kelley, the CCL Small Offensive Lineman of the Year. &lsquo;&lsquo;Our skill positions were hit hard by graduation and we will be young and inexperienced, although we have some talent there,&rsquo;&rsquo; Houston said.

Working against them will be the limitations of being a smaller school, with the Hutton citing a turnout of just 30 players this season. One of those athletes will need to fill the Hornets&rsquo; quarterback vacancy. However, the team does return its entire backfield and offensive line, and those two units will stabilize the offense as it integrates a new quarterback.</p><p>

Senior quarterback Jack Maguire returns for a team that reached the Division 4A South semifinals last season. Maguire will have seniors Brian Cashman and Kyle Rogers as returning targets. Coach James Kelliher said senior Ethan Curtin will be among players to watch as a wideout that has developed into a well-rounded talent. Seniors Garrett Porter (guard) and Mike Broomstein (tackle) will help a younger line get adjusted to the next level. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think once they get adjusted, the incoming sophomores will make a mark,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kelliher. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think we can surprise some people.

Both three-year starters can stop the run and play in pass coverage, according to head coach Bill Kinsherf. Senior running back Oronde Alfred returns to the lineup after rushing for 455 yards and five touchdowns. At quarterback, replacing three-year starter Jack Rega will be key.

After having a roster of mostly sophomores last season, coach Dan Haddad feels that the fear of playing a tough schedule has waned for this team. Replacing running back Zach Levy (21 touchdowns) will be a tall task for, but Haddad feels the offense is a strength. Senior AJ Pelletier will step in as an elusive back with a mix of power. Junior Jim Kilduff will take over under center, a quick quarterback with a strong arm, according to Haddad.

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Last year was a learning curve for a team of mostly underclassmen. With the majority of the team returning, coach John McIntyre feels confident in this group. The Canalmen will move from a Spread offense to a Double Wing, hoping to establish the ground game early behind an experienced front seven.

Moving from the Spread to a Wing T will be a point of concern, along with getting a new quarterback adjusted. Mobile quarterbacks senior Devin Proulx and sophomore Danny Silva will compete for the job. Couto and junior Chris Costa (12 touchdowns) return at running back and should help provide an early boost. &lsquo;&lsquo;I feel that we have the talent and ability to be a playoff team,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Palladino. &lsquo;&lsquo;We just have to be sound at running and stopping the run.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

The coaching staff will also return. &lsquo;&lsquo;The senior class has been very helpful with my transition,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Perry. Key players include senior linebacker/fullback Eli Nickerson. A solid tackler, he&rsquo;ll be making the transition to fullback. Junior quarterback Isaac Hart will step in under center, a mobile pocket-passer that has continued to impress. Perry and his team feel they will be better than the 6-5 record they set as a goal for this season. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s an excitement around the program that we haven&rsquo;t seen in years,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Perry. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to reinforce that they have to work hard and earn it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

While defense is a strength, the return of senior back Alex Small and three-year starter Jack Holdgate only bolster the lineup. Other key players include sophomore back/strong safety Torrane Burton, who emerged as a top player last season. Senior Max Cunningham will give the team options at wide reciever, a player with long reach and solid catching ability. &ldquo;I feel like we have a lot of individual talent,&rdquo; said Ryder. &ldquo;These kids are skilled, but the key is that individual talent doesn&rsquo;t win games - a team does.&rdquo;</p><p>
