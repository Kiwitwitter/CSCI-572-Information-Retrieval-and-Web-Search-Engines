<p>  Thier's lawyers cautioned that a written agreement between the state's biggest hospital company and its biggest health insurer that would make insurance  more expensive statewide might raise legal questions about  anticompetitive behavior, according to officials directly involved in  the talks.</p><amp-iframe width="auto" height="220" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms" layout="fixed-height" frameborder="0" src="https://c.a0bg.com/Fragment/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/skins/leaf/story/dynamic_newsletter.jpt?section=%2fspecials&googleArticle=yes"></amp-iframe>

<p> And so, in May 2000, the two simply shook hands on this: Van Faasen would give Partners doctors and hospitals the biggest insurance payment increase since Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's hospitals agreed to join forces in 1993.</p><p>  In return, Thier would protect Blue Cross from Van Faasen's biggest fear: that Partners would allow other insurers to pay less. Those who helped broker the deal  say Thier promised he would push for the same or bigger payment  increases for everything from X-rays to brain surgery from Van Faasen's  competition, ensuring that all major insurers would face tens of  millions in cost increases. Blue Cross called it a "market covenant."</p><p> The deal, never before made public, marked the beginning of a period of rapid escalation in Massachusetts insurance  prices, a Spotlight Team investigation has found, as Partners  repeatedly used its clout to get rate increases and other hospitals  tried to keep up. Individual insurance premiums have risen 8.9 percent a year ever since the "market covenant," state figures show, more than twice the annual rise in the late 1990s.</p><p> Both Partners and Blue Cross  deny that they acted improperly in the 2000 payment negotiations or in  their dealings since. Partners issued a statement saying that Thier  pledged only that he would treat all insurers equally. Blue Cross executives have said that the big pay raise to Partners in 2000 was needed to offset years of low rates.</p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

<p> But plainly Thier's attorneys were wary of the legal risk of even  discussing a market-setting agreement, those involved in the talks say.   And soon it would be obvious why.</p><p>  By spring 2001, Thier had pressured two insurers, Tufts and Harvard  Pilgrim Health Care, to give Partners rate increases as large or larger  than Blue Cross got.  Partners' internal memos reviewed by the Globe show officials knew that  insurers would have little choice but to raise prices to consumers to  cover the new Partners rates.</p><p> Thus it was that a company originally launched with the promise of  saving hundreds of millions of dollars by consolidating two famous  hospitals instead became a driving force behind the high cost of medicine in Massachusetts. Blue Cross  has increased the rate it pays Partners by 75 percent since 2000, far  more than increases given to other teaching hospitals that mainly treat  adults. Other insurers have boosted payments to Partners by a similar  amount.</p><p> Over the last 15 years, Partners has become the state's  largest private employer and its biggest healthcare provider, treating  more than a third of hospital patients in the Boston metropolitan area.  Partners has built a biomedical research juggernaut larger than Harvard  University's and embarked on a multibillion-dollar expansion program  that rivals those of all other Massachusetts hospitals combined. A  doctors' magazine recently named Partners' current chief executive the  most powerful physician executive in the nation.</p><p> Company officials and industry allies say Partners shouldn't be blamed  for medical inflation, which is a national problem. And they say that  their rise to power gave Massachusetts a needed counterforce to insurance  companies that underpaid hospitals and doctors through much of the  1990s. In 2001, Thier told the Globe he wanted to "reset the prices"  that insurers pay hospitals and doctors in Massachusetts, predicting  that "that should help other providers as well."</p><p> Partners officials also contend that much of the criticism comes from  jealous rivals, noting that several others tried but failed to build  multihospital corporations like Partners, which now includes eight  hospitals. "Most people will say we executed relatively well," said  Peter Markell, Partners' chief financial officer. "Everybody else didn't  execute well."</p><p> Few question the managerial and strategic acuity of Partners'  management, or the devotion and skill of its doctors and nurses. But  Partners has enjoyed other profound advantages in the 15 years since its  founding, a period in which, according to Partners' financial  statements, its patient volume more than doubled, revenue rose nearly  400 percent, and profits grew by even more.</p><p> Formed in an era of fervent deregulation, Partners has benefited  throughout its history from remarkably limited government oversight,  considering the vast impact of the merger on the medical marketplace.  The administration of Governor William F. Weld never held a public  hearing before approving the merger of the state's two biggest hospitals. And the state  sharply curtailed regulation of hospital expansion in the 1990s,  freeing Partners to dramatically expand into the suburbs, drawing  patients and revenue from already struggling community hospitals.</p><p> As the state slashed oversight of healthcare, no private company was able and willing to moderate Partners' ambitions. Blue Cross, which now controls 60 percent of the health insurance market, was best positioned to do so but flinched at the possibility of a public tangle. As former Blue Cross  executive Peter Meade said at a meeting of company executives in 2000  at which some urged a tougher stand against Partners: "Excuse me, did  anyone here save anyone's life today? We are a successful business up  against people that save people's lives. It's not a fair fight."</p><p> In this laissez-faire environment, Partners has been free to use highly aggressive tactics with hospitals and insurance  companies, especially those that don't accede to its demands. In 2007,  Partners expelled 290 doctors at Beverly Hospital from its system,  exposing them to substantial pay cuts, because  they were sending some patients to teaching hospitals outside of  Partners - which Partners said made it hard to monitor quality.</p><p> Today Partners dominates what was once one of the most competitive  healthcare markets in the world, with a hospital and physician network  big enough to overwhelm competitors and intimidate insurers.</p><p> Even some people who helped create Partners have become disillusioned at  how inequitable Massachusetts healthcare has become as Partners'  strength has grown. While Partners and a few other powerful hospital  companies saw major insurance payment  increases, many others were left behind, including teaching hospitals  that care for patients just as sick as those at the Brigham and Mass.  General. Partners' flagship hospitals typically earn 30 percent more  than other academic medical centers that treat adults, representing  hundreds of millions in extra payments to Partners each year.</p><p> Blue Cross has  prospered, too, gaining more members in 2000 than any other year and  watching profits soar from $82.7 million in 2002 to more than $200  million a year in each of the next five years.</p><p> Ellen Zane, Partners' chief negotiator in 2000, said she didn't realize  the extent to which other hospitals were not keeping up with Partners  until she left to become president of Tufts Medical Center in 2004. </p><p> "It turned out that insurers didn't support all hospitals as we thought  they would," said Zane, who said her hospital won't survive if insurers  don't substantially increase reimbursement rates. "I was quite surprised  by the rate disparity when I came to Tufts Medical Center. In some  ways, it defied logic."</p><p> Tufts' patients, on average, are sicker than either Mass. General's or  the Brigham's, based on a standard measure of patients' average severity  level. But Tufts Medical Center is paid about 35 percent less,  according to confidential Blue Cross rate information obtained by the Globe.</p><p>
<b class="b">An unlikely alliance </b>
</p><p> Many physicians at New England's oldest and biggest hospital, Mass.  General, didn't take the news well that they were about to merge with  Brigham and Women's across town. They viewed  the Brigham as fast-rising and eager but hardly the equal of "The  General," the first teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. </p><p> As one senior physician at Mass. General wryly observed about being  asked to collaborate with the Brigham: "I was raised to hate three  things: the Soviet Union, the Brigham, and Yale."</p><p> But at the press conference announcing the deal  in December 1993, leaders of the two hospitals said their alliance  would only make them greater. They described twin ambitions underpinning  their once unthinkable alliance: to build a high-quality healthcare  system, and to save money. A lot of money.</p><p> They said their goal was to cut 20 percent out of their combined $1.2 billion annual budget, which meant saving $240 million a year.</p><p> "Put it this way," said Dr. J. Robert Buchanan, who was then the head of  Mass. General. "We're pretty sure we've got to save 20 percent at  minimum."</p><p> The Boston Consulting Group, which helped facilitate the merger, told the hospitals that they could reduce annual costs  by between 12 percent and 28 percent, according to a description of the  consultants' analysis in a 1996 Harvard Business School study of the  merger. Partners would not provide the consultants' recommendations to  the Globe.</p><p> But Partners made only a small fraction of the cuts. The company claims that the merger saved $200 million to $250 million - total - over five years.</p><p> Those savings came almost exclusively from administrative consolidation.  The two hospitals have rarely collaborated on clinical operations. In  fact, soon after the merger, Mass. General opened a new obstetrics unit  that would compete with its sister hospital at a time of declining  births in Massachusetts.</p><p> Partners' current management denies that saving such large sums was ever  the intention, and argues the smaller amount they did save was a  commendable achievement. Jay B. Pieper, then the Brigham's chief  financial officer and now a Partners vice president, suggested there was  no basis for the comments Buchanan made at the press conference.</p><p> "Everybody kind of scratched their head and said, 'Bob, what did you mean?' " Pieper said.</p><p> According to Pieper and others, melding of medical services would not  have saved much since each hospital had programs large enough to achieve  economies of scale on their own. Consolidation would have  inconvenienced patients and driven away top physicians, they said.</p><p> But Buchanan and other Partners founders told the Globe recently that  their original intention had been the consolidation of services, at  least for rare treatments, and possibly many more. The idea was "to have  at least one superb major teaching hospital when all this is over,"  said Dr. Eugene Braunwald, Partners' former chief of research, who said  that didn't happen because their finances never deteriorated to the  point they had feared.</p><p> The year before his death in 1998, Partners cofounder Dr. H. Richard  Nesson told the Globe that he was still looking for ways to consolidate.</p><p> "I do not believe, for example, that we should both be doing every kind of transplant," Nesson said.</p><p> A decade later, Partners continues to offer an array of competing  transplant programs, even though surgeons sometimes struggle to find  enough work to keep skills sharp. Mass. General surgeons performed fewer  than the minimum 10 lung transplants per year required for Medicare  certification in four of the last seven years, drawing a letter of  concern from federal regulators in 2006. The Mass. General surgeons  wrote back that their work is of such high quality that low volume is  not a hazard.</p><p> The Brigham added a new pancreas transplant program recently, even  though the existing program at Mass. General typically does only one or  two transplants a year. Brigham surgeons predicted to the state they would perform 10 pancreas transplants in 2007, but they did only two.</p><p> "One way to look at that is, well, that's just a  bunch of doctors running rampant; another way to look at that is, you  need to have the reason that those best doctors are with you," said  Pieper. He said transplant programs lure top surgeons and are not  necessarily expensive: "You should never believe it is not a competitive  world."</p><p>
<b class="b"> A changing environment </b>
</p><p> Weld and the Legislature unleashed the forces that led to the creation of Partners when they ended the state's  authority to regulate hospital rates in 1992. Beacon Hill wanted to  force hospitals to jockey for contracts with savings-minded HMOs, which,  at the time, sent their members only to select hospitals and doctors. </p><p> "I favor putting the scorpions in the same bottle . . . and letting them  fight it out," said Democrat Edward L. Burke, then cochairman of the  Legislature's healthcare committee.</p><p> That they did. But as hospitals competed to offer the lowest price and  insurers demanded shorter hospital stays, many institutions, including  Mass. General and the Brigham, had to close beds and lay off staff.  Mergers were seen as a way to survive.</p><p> Many doctors saw Mass. General and the Brigham as unlikely partners,  given their years of heated rivalry for physicians, students, and  research grants. Still, the reasons to get together were compelling:  Each brought to the table prestige and financial resources no other  partner could match. Once leaders from the two hospitals broached the  subject in 1993, the deal came together in less than six months.</p><p> Heads of other major Harvard teaching hospitals were aghast at the news,  since they thought they'd been in serious talks about building a  five-hospital Harvard system.</p><p> "It's almost akin to right in the middle of the [Celtics] season Paul  Pierce and Kevin Garnett went off with their agents and decided they  could form a better team," recalled David Weiner, then CEO of Children's  Hospital, one of the five.</p><p> That was how Partners would come to be seen by the rest of the medical  community, with a mix of envy, loathing, and admiration: a  business-savvy organization willing to play hardball in what had been a  genteel white-coat world.</p><p> Coincidentally, the day after the merger was announced, it became public  that Mass. General had chosen a new leader, Thier, who eventually  became the second CEO of Partners. More than anyone, he is seen as the  architect of the healthcare giant and its  aggressive market strategies. He was, and is, formidable by almost any  measure - in intellect, charm, and competitive fire.</p><p> "In my view, it was a sacred responsibility . . . to make sure this  institution and the Brigham were not done in by the changing  environment," Thier said in an interview at his office at Mass. General,  where he drank coffee from a mug with a red slash through the word  "whining" - as in "no whining."</p><p> Thier made it clear how important he felt it had been to stand up to the insurers and demand higher rates.</p><p> "What [the two hospitals] do is so important to this region, to the  country, so I was going to be tough in terms of people who were taking  decisions . . . that were going to injure these places."</p><p>
<b class="b"> A prescient prediction </b>
</p><p> Though many analysts saw the merger as a smart way to reduce costs, three Boston University School of Public Health researchers warned at the time that it "actually may increase the cost of care," adding a layer of bureaucracy while boosting the market power of the combined institution. </p><p> "The merged hospital would have great ability to resist payers' demands  for discounts," wrote Alan Sager, Deborah Socolar, and Peter Hiam in the  Boston Business Journal.</p><p> In fact, that thought was high in the minds of Partners' founders.</p><p> "There was a feeling . . . that the insurance  companies are so big and we're so small," said Jack Connors, then a  Brigham trustee and now chairman of Partners' board. "The only way we  can really have leverage at the table is if we become big."</p><p> Charles Baker, Weld's secretary of Health and Human Services, came to  regret signing off on the merger when he later became CEO of Harvard  Pilgrim Health Care and sat across the  bargaining table from Partners. He has compared it to "having the  grenade that you throw on one end of the boat roll back down and blow up  on you when the boat shifts."</p><p> Attorney General Scott Harshbarger also approved the deal, urging the hospitals "to pass on any cost savings to consumers."</p><p> But neither Harshbarger nor other regulators who approved the merger  imagined the way that Partners would come to dominate Boston healthcare.  First, the company set up a for-profit subsidiary to recruit 1,000  community doctors who could act as "feeders," referring serious cases to  the downtown hospitals. Partners gave Ellen Zane $100 million to  purchase major physicians' practices.</p><p> Then Partners began to build a network, acquiring strategically located  hospitals to the north, west, and south of the city. In the process, the  company rejuvenated money-losing hospitals in Lynn, Newton, and Jamaica  Plain.</p><p> "Partners got started for the right reasons," said Zane, who was one of  the first employees recruited by Nesson, Partners' first CEO. "Dick  believed we had a responsibility to change how care was delivered in  this country. Partners wanted to be a leader in creating a more equal  balance between insurers and all providers."</p><p>
<b class="b"> A giant expands </b>
</p><p> It's little more than a hole in the ground now, but the $686 million  10-story addition underway at Mass. General will be the costliest  hospital project in state history, and one of  the most expensive in the country, according to a leading construction  consultant. The facility, which will expand bed capacity by 17 percent,  is not so much gold-plated as it is vaultingly ambitious: a state-of-the-art expansion nestled inside an existing hospital. </p><p> Across town, the Brigham recently opened a $382  million heart center equipped with the world's most powerful CT  scanner. In the suburbs, major new outpatient centers are taking shape  in Danvers and at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough.</p><p> All this costly work makes it hard to believe that, in the early 1990s,  Partners officials thought they might have to close entire wings of the  Brigham and the General due to declining hospitalization rates. Today  the beds are full, and the company's $2.5 billion expansion and  renovation program over the last five years dwarfs everyone else's. For  comparison, Children's Hospital, the second most prosperous Boston  hospital company, planned to spend $240 million on construction this  year before the recession trimmed spending by one-third.</p><p> It turns out that the star power of Mass. General and the Brigham fills  beds even at a time when more procedures are done on an outpatient basis  and the number of hospitalizations is stagnant. Then, as Partners  merged with some hospitals and formed close alliances with others, its  dominance grew. Today the company says it controls 22 percent of the  eastern Massachusetts inpatient market. But the percentage of patients  living in the four counties nearest Boston who were discharged from a  Partners-affiliated hospital rose from 19 percent to 37 percent from  1996 to 2006, according to the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium.</p><p> Despite its power, Partners has never earned more than a 2 percent  operating profit, which is modest compared with major teaching hospitals  in other states. It is a rate the hospitals  deliberately keep low. The company aims for 2 percent profit each year,  then calculates how much money is available for new projects, according  to Markell. Because of Partners' size and substantial investments, the  company reported $1.7 billion in total income from 2003 to 2007 - more  than the next six Massachusetts hospital companies combined during the  period - but that still left billions for growth.</p><p> "Our surpluses get invested back into either the community or the  hospitals or whatever," Connors said. "It's a billion dollars [a year]  either on bricks and mortar, technology, or information systems. . . .  And in my opinion, it's a race, if you will."</p><p> All the expansion worries healthcare analysts watching the medical arms  race spiral. Dr. Donald M. Berwick, head of the Institute for Healthcare  Improvement in Cambridge and a leading healthcare reformer, said new  medical facilities generate their own demand, because when there is more  treatment available, doctors order more care for their patients.</p><p> "When Partners decides to expand . . . the prediction would be it will  not add to the well-being of the population," he said. "It will add to cost."</p><p> But Partners officials see it differently, noting that state  attorneys general have successfully discouraged Partners from acquiring  at least four doctors groups or clinics in recent years. Partners  officials believe that they've been unfairly limited, and that if they  could establish more suburban facilities, fewer suburban patients would  travel to downtown hospitals.</p><p> &ldquo;You've got to take the shackles off on that,&rdquo; Markell said. &ldquo;We've got  to be allowed to be what we need to be. We have two downtown hospitals. We&rsquo;ve got Newton-Wellesley and we&rsquo;ve got North Shore, but we have nothing in the whole south corridor.&rdquo;</p><p>
<b class="b"> An object lesson </b>
</p><p> Dr. Harris Berman said he felt like he'd wandered into an ambush. </p><p> The chief executive of Tufts Health Plan thought he had been invited to  the Prudential tower on Oct. 23, 2000, to continue contract talks with  top Partners officials. Thier, the Partners chief, wanted a substantial  increase in payments for medical services, $100 million more than Berman  was willing to pay for the care of his members over three years.</p><p> But Thier was done talking. He told Berman that Tufts insurance  would no longer be accepted at Partners starting April 1. It was a  devastating blow to Tufts' business. Almost as soon as Berman left his  office, Thier launched a million-dollar marketing campaign to drive the  point home. Signs went up at Partners reception desks notifying Tufts  members that their insurance would soon be  denied. A new website told them how to switch insurers. A call center in  Texas was set up to field questions from worried patients and doctors.</p><p> Within days, major employers and thousands of Tufts members began  threatening to cancel their policies. Tufts surrendered in little more  than a week.</p><p> "I finally concluded, in the middle of the night one night, that our very viability was at stake," Berman recalled later.</p><p> The humiliation of Tufts became an object lesson for other insurers, a  lesson they would not soon forget. The balance of power had shifted, and  necessarily so, Thier said.</p><p> "If the market didn't change, we were going out of business," Thier  said. "We were taking care of patients, and if anything happened to us,  we were going to have a public health catastrophe, but if anything  happens to them, somebody else is going to come in and sell insurance."</p><p> Like Tufts, Blue Cross  had initially balked at paying Partners the extra $193 million over  three years that Partners demanded, according to an internal memo  reviewed by the Globe. Blue Cross  had hired analyst Nancy Kane of the Harvard School of Public Health to  study the request, and she concluded that Partners was financially much  stronger than the company admitted. However, Blue Cross leaders feared they would lose if the dispute became public, according to a former Blue Cross executive involved in the talks.</p><p> So Blue Cross  negotiators said they would give Partners the money - as long as  Partners sought similar or larger raises from other insurers. The  company's main concern in giving in to Partners' requested 19 percent  increase over three years was that Partners might accept less from other  insurers, putting Blue Cross at a disadvantage. At the time, Partners officials estimated that Blue Cross would have to raise premiums by about 2 percent to cover the Partners' rate hike.</p><p> For Partners, it was a huge victory, according to officials involved in  the negotiations, the first time the company had successfully used its  bargaining clout. And Thier's sense of obligation to protect Blue Cross  from financial disadvantage gave the negotiators the resolve to seek  even more from Tufts, officials involved in the talks said.</p><p> At the time the Berman-Thier talks broke down, Tufts was offering $81 million less than the amount necessary to "match Blue Cross," according to an internal Partners memo reviewed by the Globe. The terms of the "market covenant" with Blue Cross wouldn't allow that.</p><p> Partners might have been able to extract big rate increases from all three insurers without making the deal with Blue Cross, but it would have been difficult. The Van Faasen-Thier agreement averted a brewing public showdown between Partners and Blue Cross,  a company with three times as many members as Tufts, while giving  Partners powerful leverage in their subsequent talks with the smaller  insurers.</p><p>
<b class="b"> 'Normal back and forth' </b>
</p><p> Former state attorney general Thomas F. Reilly, the state's  chief antitrust official from 1999 to 2007, said he never saw anything  close to a violation by Partners during his tenure. Reilly said he did  not know about Thier's 2000 promise to Blue Cross, but said he would consider that "a normal back and forth in the negotiations." </p><p> However, some antitrust lawyers to whom the Spotlight Team described the deal say the Partners-Blue Cross deal raises suspicions, partly because the two companies were so big that they could work in concert to set insurance prices, preventing other insurers from competing on price.</p><p> The agreements "raise an obvious antitrust issue," said Keith Hylton, a  law professor at Boston University who has written a book on antitrust  issues. If the biggest insurer is able to dictate how much other  insurers have to pay hospitals and doctors, he said, it prevents other  insurers from offering lower premiums to their members.</p><p> "They make it hard for anyone to cut a side deal" that saves consumers money, Hylton said.</p><p> David Balto, who has challenged hospital mergers in court and served as  policy director to the Federal Trade Commission under President Clinton,  said Partners and Blue Cross could yet be penalized under Massachusetts consumer protection law if the 2000 deal unfairly increased insurance  premiums and the effects are still being felt today. He also said that  there is no time limit under federal law to reverse a merger if the  merger has led to unwarranted price increases.</p><p> Balto, now in private practice in Washington, D.C., said Partners' relationship with Blue Cross "has the effect of raising prices for consumers."</p><p> "The is a simple case," he said. "This should be on top of the enforcement agenda for the [Massachusetts] attorney general."</p><p> But a former colleague of Balto's at the Federal Trade Commission who now consults for Blue Cross  said it would be hard to prove that the Van Faasen-Thier agreement  violated any law. Robert Leibenluft said it would depend on exactly what  was promised and whether the verbal pledge could be enforced.</p><p> "There would be a whole lot to figure out whether there's something [illegal] to it or not," he said in an interview.</p><p> Partners officials stressed that its contract with Blue Cross in 2000 was far from unique, noting that big teaching hospitals across the country cut favorable contracts with insurers in 2000 and 2001, creating a shift in political power from the HMOs to the hospitals.</p><p> This much is plain: The generous Partners contracts of 2000 and 2001 marked a turning point in Massachusetts insurance  prices after which one hospital after another demanded "Partners rates"  from insurers. Partners won an even bigger rate increase from Blue Cross  in 2003: 47 percent over five years. Today Massachusetts hospitals  account for more than half of medical inflation, according to Blue Cross data.</p><p> Blue Cross officials say they shouldn't be blamed for the run-up in insurance prices, arguing they always cut the best deals  possible with hospitals for their 3 million members. They say that they  are aware that Partners and a few other hospitals get paid more than  other hospitals, but that there is a limit to what they can do.</p><p> "We have to stay very attuned to the balance of the market, but we are  not a regulator," said Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president of Blue Cross, suggesting that market "fairness" is a public policy issue beyond the control of any one company.</p><p> Partners officials, too, say they shouldn't be blamed, arguing that they  sought only rate increases that were necessary to cover their rising costs and to improve their system.</p><p> "I'm not being cute here," said Partners chairman Connors. "I don't ever  remember anybody suggesting that if we merged, healthcare would be  cheaper." </p><p>
<i class="i">CORRECTION: 2/1/2009 Correction: Because of a reporting error, a Page One story on Dec. 28, 2008 mischaracterized the tax status of Partners Community Healthcare Inc., a physicians network. It is a not-for-profit corporation that is taxable. The same story also garbled a quote by Partners executive Peter Markell. He said: &ldquo;We have two downtown hospitals. We&rsquo;ve got Newton-Wellesley and we&rsquo;ve got North Shore, but we have nothing in the whole south corridor.&rdquo;</i>
