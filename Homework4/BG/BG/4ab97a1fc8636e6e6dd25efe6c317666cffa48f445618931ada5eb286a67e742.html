<p>Northwestern&rsquo;s last drive was thwarted when quarterback Clayton Thorson couldn&rsquo;t find a receiver out of his own end zone and was sacked by safety D'Cota Dixon for a safety.</p><amp-iframe width="auto" height="220" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms" layout="fixed-height" frameborder="0" src="https://c.a0bg.com/Fragment/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/skins/leaf/story/dynamic_newsletter.jpt?section=%2fsports%2fcolleges&googleArticle=yes"></amp-iframe>

<p>Thorson was having a good quarter until then, throwing two TD passes in less than two minutes. The second to Garrett Dickerson with 2:53 left got the Wildcats within a touchdown.</p><p>But Wisconsin (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) stood up the Wildcats (2-2, 0-1) again late to seal the win in each team&rsquo;s conference opener.</p><p class="noprint">It was all Wisconsin in the second half until Northwestern&rsquo;s late push in the fourth.</p><p class="noprint">Hornibrook hit Quintez Cephus on a 61-yard pass to the Northwestern 11 on the Badgers&rsquo; first drive of the third quarter.

<p class="noprint">Safety Natrell Jamerson had a 36-yard interception return for a touchdown for a 31-10 lead with 9:54 left in the game, what initially looked like the final blow to Northwestern.</p><p class="noprint">But the Wildcats came back. Wisconsin allowed two quick touchdowns before Dixon&rsquo;s safety finally finished off Northwestern.</p><p class="noprint">Taylor, a freshman, finished with 80 yards on 19 carries.

He hauled in his 180th career catch in the fourth quarter to set the record held by Deon Butler since 2008.</p><p>Barkley returned the game&rsquo;s opening kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown and finished with 221 yards to pad his Heisman Trophy r&eacute;sum&eacute;. </p><p class="noprint">Penn State turned two first-quarter Indiana turnovers into touchdowns to spark the rout.

<b class="b">Georgia 41, Tennessee 0</b> &mdash; Jake Fromm threw a touchdown pass and ran for two more scores in Knoxville, Tenn., as the No. 7 Bulldogs (5-0, 2-0 SEC) sent the Volunteers (3-2, 0-2) to their first shutout loss in nearly a quarter-century.</p><p>Nick Chubb added 109 yards rushing as Georgia raced to its first 5-0 start since 2012, the last year the Bulldogs reached the SEC championship game. Tennessee was shut out for the first time since a 31-0 loss to Florida in 1994.</p><p class="noprint">The Bulldogs got more good news in the fourth quarter when quarterback Jacob Eason made his first appearance since spraining his left knee in the season opener. Fromm was 7 of 15 for 84 yards and rushed for 20 yards before giving way to Eason with the game in hand.</p><p>
<b class="b">Auburn 49, Mississippi State 10</b> &mdash; Jarrett Stidham passed for 264 yards and two touchdowns, and Kerryon Johnson ran for 116 yards and three scores to lead the No. 13 Tigers (4-1, 2-0 SEC) over the Bulldogs (3-2, 1-2) in Auburn, Ala.</p><p class="noprint">    Auburn etablished itself as the most likely challenger to No. 1 Alabama in the Western Division with an explosive offensive performance.

<b class="b">South Florida 61, East Carolina 31 </b>&mdash; Quinton Flowers threw for two touchdowns and ran for another, and the No. 18 Bulls (5-0, 2-0 American) extended their school-record winning streak to 10, routing the Pirates (1-4, 1-1) in Greenville, S.C. </p><p class="noprint">D'Ernest Johnson rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns, Marquez Valdes-Scantling took an end-around 75 yards for a touchdown and caught a 4-yard scoring pass from Flowers, and Auggie Sanchez returned an interception 43 yards for a TD.</p><p class="noprint">South Florida overcame some rare struggles on defense and remained perfect under first-year coach Charlie Strong by scoring on 10 of the 12 possessions with the starting offense. USF outscored the East Carolina, 30-7, in the second half.</p><p>
<b class="b">Florida 38, Vanderbilt 24</b> &mdash; In Gainesville, Fla., Lamical Perine scored three touchdowns, Malik Davis added two, and the No. 21 Gators (3-1, 3-0 SEC) beat the Commodores (3-2, 0-2) despite losing quarterback Luke Del Rio to a broken left collarbone. </p><p class="noprint">Perine bookended two 1-yard plunges around a 13-yard scamper as the Gators stayed unbeaten in SEC play and beat the Commodores for the 26th time in the last 27 meetings.</p><p class="noprint">Perine, a cousin of former Oklahoma and current Washington Redskins running back Samaje Perine, finished with 58 yards on 15 carries.</p><p class="noprint">Davis, a freshman, ran 17 times for 124 yards. His final run was huge. On a fourth-down play, Davis broke through the line, stumbled and then regained his footing for a 39-yard score that sealed the victory.</p><p>
<b class="b">Notre Dame 52, Miami (Ohio) 17</b> &mdash;  Brandon Wimbush threw for three touchdowns and ran for another in South Bend, Ind., as the No. 22 Fighting Irish (4-1) rolled over the RedHawks (2-3) for the 900th victory in school history.</p><p>Josh Adams added touchdown runs of 72 and 59 yards in the first half before leaving the game with an injury to his left ankle. Adams, who entered the game as the No. 9 rusher in the country, still led the Notre Dame with 159 yards on the ground despite the short night.</p><p class="noprint"> Wimbush, who had his eighth rushing touchdown of the season in the first quarter, finished with 119 passing yards in three quarters and had 36 yards on 11 carries. The Irish led the RedHawks, 45-14 at the half, the most first-half points scored by an Irish team under Kelly.</p><p>

<b class="b">Troy 24, LSU 21 </b>&mdash; Jordan Chunn rushed for 191 yards and a touchdown as the Trojans (4-1) stunned the No. 25 Tigers (3-2) in Baton Rouge, La.</p><p>      Brandon Silvers was 16-for-28 passing for 157 yards for Troy, which has won four straight since a season-opening loss at Boise State. Danny Etling was 17 of 25 for 198 yards for fading LSU, which narrowly avoided an upset against Syracuse last Saturday after losing to Mississippi State two weeks ago.</p><p>
<b class="b">Lafayette 10, Holy Cross 7 </b>&mdash; Jeffrey Kordenbrock&rsquo;s 43-yard field goal on the last play of the game gave the Leopards (1-4, 1-0 Patriot League) their first win of the season. The lone score for the host Crusaders (2-3, 1-1) came on Miles Alexander&rsquo;s 8-yard run in the second quarter.</p><h3 class="subhead">
