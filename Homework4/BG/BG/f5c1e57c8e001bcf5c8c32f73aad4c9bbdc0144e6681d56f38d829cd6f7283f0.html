<p>McAvoy is playing for the Bruins, Clayton Keller is with the Arizona Coyotes, and Kieffer Bellows went to play junior hockey in the WHL. Only defensemen Dante Fabbro and Chad Krys and forward Patrick Harper are actually sophomores going to classes and playing for BU. </p><p>Three years ago, the Terriers had Hobey Baker Award winner Jack Eichel &mdash; for one season.  He left for the Buffalo Sabres.
</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get six players in a class who are not going to stay for four years,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Quinn, who is entering his fifth year as BU coach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to put together a team. </p><p>&ldquo;And one of the things that can happen is you get caught up in the flash, and the hype of a player, yet if he&rsquo;s only going to be there for a year, why? And you&rsquo;ve got a chance to recruit somebody who isn&rsquo;t going to make quite the impact their freshman year as that one player might but he&rsquo;s going to be there for four years, you&rsquo;ve got to take that guy. </p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a balancing act in that process and I think we&rsquo;re starting to pay a lot more attention to that in our recruiting.&rdquo;</p><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of flash in this year&rsquo;s crop of BU freshmen, too. Five were drafted in June, and one is projected to be a high pick next year. Sophomore goalie Jake Oettinger also was grabbed by the Stars in the first round in 2017.</p><p>The trouble with recruiting such brilliant star power is that the pros want those stars, too, and they don&rsquo;t really care that they are only sophomores in college. </p><p>&ldquo;Programs are at different stages,&rsquo;&rsquo; Quinn explained, &ldquo;and I thought it was fun when I first got there to get those high-end flash guys &mdash; and they were great players and they&rsquo;ve done great things for us. </p><p>&ldquo;But as you go along, I think every coach evolves with the program. You need to figure out what you need and what&rsquo;s the best formula to have success. I think that happens in every sport.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Quinn is quick to acknowledge that he and BU are fortunate to have an awful lot of things going for them: the tradition and prominence of the program, the location in the city hard by Fenway Park, a top-notch facility, a great staff.  </p><p>&ldquo;We certainly don&rsquo;t lose sight of that,&rdquo; Quinn said. &ldquo;There are so many good coaches and good programs across the country and in our league that you&rsquo;ve got to work at it and you can&rsquo;t take anything for granted. Our league is so good, top to bottom, with so many good coaches. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Looking around when they&rsquo;re all in a room, it really jumps out at you.&rdquo;</p><p>One of those Hockey East coaches is Boston College&rsquo;s Jerry York, who has had his share of prominent draft picks but none this year. Like many, York sees recruiting as cyclical.  </p><p>&ldquo;It does go in cycles a little bit,&rsquo;&rsquo; York said. &ldquo;You get one really top player like Johnny Gaudreau, it brings other players. And I think McAvoy was one of their key guys. But it runs in cycles.&rdquo;</p><p>Quinn agreed: &ldquo;You get Jack Eichel and all of a sudden Clayton Keller says, &lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll go to BU.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just a domino effect.&rdquo;</p><p>Holding on to players bound for the NHL is difficult, particularly when lucrative contracts are dangled in front of them. Playing in the NHL is the ultimate dream for a lot of these kids. Hard to fight that. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a battle out there, that&rsquo;s for sure,&rsquo;&rsquo; said York. &ldquo;Seeing more and more of the one-and-dones with us, and two-and-dones. I understand where they&rsquo;re coming from. </p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s all driven by that free agency. I think the NHL Players Association and the owners have to get together and not say he&rsquo;s going to be a complete free agent if he stays four years. Because now it&rsquo;s not even four years; they go when they&rsquo;re juniors, three years. </p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re rushing to sign kids because they&rsquo;re afraid to lose them. That&rsquo;s not good for either party, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as the recruiting cycle can lift a program, it can bring it down. BC has no seniors on its team this year. Two seasons ago, there was a mass exodus, when seven underclassmen left for the pros. </p><p>There&rsquo;s another way to do it. One of the other perennially successful coaches in Hockey East is Lowell&rsquo;s Norm Bazin. He&rsquo;s not looking for NHL draft picks. He wants &ldquo;a kid that fits our program, a kid that&rsquo;s maybe a late developer, a kid that maybe is being overlooked.</p><p>&ldquo;Our assistants dig them up because they know what they&rsquo;re looking for for our type of program and what&rsquo;s valuable to us,&rdquo; Bazin said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got kids from five different countries, five different Canadian provinces, and 15 different US states, so we&rsquo;re looking everywhere.&rdquo; </p><p class="noprint">The players at Lowell are more likely to stay in school for at least three years. 
</p><p class="noprint">&ldquo;The NHL has gone very young, and some of the guys are getting picked off at a young age,&rsquo;&rsquo; Bazin said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of having a great league like Hockey East. Three years is a benchmark.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Providence&rsquo;s Nate Leaman also has chosen to spend time hunting for lesser-known talent. </p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still losing some guys here and there [to the NHL] but that&rsquo;s part of college hockey right now,&rdquo; Leaman said. &ldquo;The NHL&rsquo;s getting younger, and because the NHL&rsquo;s getting younger, there&rsquo;s a drop-down thing.&rdquo; </p><p>Merrimack coach Mark Dennehy points to Lowell as an alternative path to great success.</p><p>&ldquo;I think hockey&rsquo;s great because you can do it a number of different ways,&rdquo; Dennehy said. &ldquo;So if you want to load up on draft picks and take a run, you&rsquo;re probably going to have a good team, good players. If you want to get late bloomers, and diamonds in the rough and buff &rsquo;em up, you can do that, too.&rdquo;</p><p></p><p class="noprint">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Hockey East at a glance</h2>
</h3><p class="noprint">(in predicted order of finish)</p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>BOSTON UNIVERSITY</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: David Quinn, 83-54-17, fifth year.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 24-12-3, 13-6-3 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to BC in Hockey East semifinals; lost Lost to Duluth in NCAA regional. 
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: The Bruins grabbed two of the Terriers&rsquo; hot shots &mdash; defenseman Charlie McAvoy (5-21&mdash;26) and forward Jakob Forsbacka-Karlsson (14-19&mdash;33) &mdash; and sleek freshman forward Clayton Keller, the team&rsquo;s top scorer (21-24&mdash;45), signed with the Coyotes. But nine freshmen and a graduate transfer replenish the stock for a team ranked No. 2 in the nation. Among the newbies are seven forwards and three defensemen, including five players selected in the 2017 NHL Draft. Among the glamour freshmen are Brady Tkachuk, son of Keith, and Ty Amonte, son of Tony; both dads are former Terriers and longtime NHLers. Brady Tkachuk was recently named Player of the Game in the All-American Prospects Game after scoring the game winner. Returning forwards include Patrick Harper, Bobo Carpenter, and Jordan Greenway. Greenway, for one, has been mentioned as an Olympic candidate. In goal is one of the nation&rsquo;s top netminders, Jake Oettinger (21-11-3, 2.11 goals against average, .927 save percentage). This Terrier team will be deeper than last year&rsquo;s talented but perhaps underperforming squad. </p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>UMASS LOWELL</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: Norm Bazin, 151-68-21, seventh year.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 27-11-3, 14-7-1 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Won Hockey East; lost to Notre Dame in NCAA regional. </p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: Lowell has been in the Hockey East championship game for five consecutive years, and while the fifth-ranked River Hawks lost five strong players (forwards Joe Gambardella, C.J. Smith, and Evan Campbell, and defensemen Dylan Zink and Michael Kapla), by the end of the season, Bazin always seems to pull together a tournament-tough team. He has six new players coming in &mdash; three forwards, three defensemen. Bazin said the young blue liners will match up with some experienced players to create a healthy mix. He calls the offense unproven. &ldquo;Losing our two best forwards and two best defensemen in terms of offensive production is considerable,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;re really looking to see how good our development was last year to see if some of our underbelly guys can take up that slack.&rdquo; Lowell has another in its long line of great goaltenders in Tyler Wall (2.06 GAA, .918 save percentage), who was named to the Hockey East all-tournament team after backstopping the River Hawks to the title. Bazin recently signed a contract extension through 2021-22. </p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>PROVIDENCE</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: Nate Leaman, 128-77-28, seventh year.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 22-12-5, 12-7-3 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Notre Dame in Hockey East quarterfinals; lost to Harvard in NCAA regional.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: Leaman was blunt: &ldquo;I think our league basically comes down to BU and everybody else.&rdquo; But he is probably too modest; the seventh-ranked Friars, who lost stellar defenseman Jake Walman to the Blues, routinely put the pieces carefully back in place to make room for themselves at the top of the conference standings. Providence should continue to have scoring depth, led by senior Brian Pinho (12-28&mdash;40) and junior Erik Foley (15-19&mdash;34). Freshmen include Islanders prospect Ben Mirageas and Blackhawks prospect Jake Ryczek. Providence also has brought on defenseman Tommy Davis, a Princeton grad, as a graduate student. Hayden Hawkey (2.19 GAA,  .913 save percentage), a Canadiens prospect, holds down the net.</p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>BOSTON COLLEGE</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: Jerry York, 566-279-80, 23rd year.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 21-15-4, 13-6-3 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Lowell in Hockey East final.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: The 13th-ranked Eagles lost leading scorers Austin Cangelosi (21-14&mdash;35), Matthew Gaudreau (8-27&mdash;35), Colin White (16-17&mdash;33), and Ryan Fitzgerald (12-19&mdash;31) and brought in five freshmen up front, including Jacob Tortora and Logan Hutsko from the US National Team Development Program, and Carlton Award winner Casey Carreau from Thayer Academy. BC also added two defensemen, including graduate student Kevin Lohan, who previously played for Michigan. The leading returning scorer is Christopher Brown (9-17&mdash;26) and the larger cast includes junior Casey Fitzgerald (5-17&mdash;22), brother of Bruins prospect Ryan and a Sabres draft pick. BC has strength in goal: Joe Woll had a 2.64 GAA and a .913 save percentage as a freshman.</p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>NORTHEASTERN</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: Jim Madigan (97-96-27, seventh year).</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 18-15-5, 9-10-3 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to BU in Hockey East quarterfinals.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: NU is coming off its fourth consecutive season of .500 or better, a feat not accomplished since 1943. They lost big-time goal scorer Zach Aston-Reese but up front the 20th-ranked Huskies have three returning 20-goal scorers in Adam Gaudette (26-26&mdash;52), Nolan Stevens (injured much of last season, 20-22&mdash;42 in 2016), and Dylan Sikura (21-36&mdash;57). All six starting defensemen return, led by Garret Cockerill (7-26&mdash;33). Madigan said there will be competition in goal, where incumbent Ryan Ruck (38 wins in two years) will be challenged by freshman Cayden Primeau, son of former NHLer Keith. Also new to the roster is Eeto Selanne, son of NHL all-time great Teemu. </p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>MERRIMACK</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: Mark Dennehy (94-77-29, 13th year).</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 15-16-6, 8-8-6 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to UNH in Hockey East first round.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: Dennehy believes the Warriors will be in the thick of it, despite losing incumbent goalie Collin Delia (signed with Blackhawks) and forward Hampus Gustafsson (15-11&mdash;26). The Warriors return 75 percent of their scoring. Brett Seney (10-21&mdash;31), the leading scorer for the last three years, is back to see if he can do it again as a senior. He tied for fifth in the nation with six game-winning goals. Senior Jace Hennig had 8 goals and 22 points last season. Five of six defensemen return, including Johnathan Kovacevic, who had 19 points as a freshman, fourth on the team. Junior Drew Vogler is the returning goalie (2.85 GAA, .897 save percentage), but he will be challenged by freshman North Carolinian Logan Hallady (via Bloomington of the USHL). </p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>NEW HAMPSHIRE</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Coach</b>: Dick Umile, 586&ndash;353&ndash;108, 28th year.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 15-20-5, 7-11-4 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Lowell in Hockey East quarterfinals. </p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: In Umile&rsquo;s final go-round as coach of the Wildcats, expect the team to improve on last year&rsquo;s 10th-place finish. &ldquo;We have a good senior class, good leadership, and I think it&rsquo;s going to be a very good group,&rsquo;&rsquo; Umile said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;a tough league, almost like two brackets. We&rsquo;re looking forward to getting back in that top bracket where we used to be all the time.&rdquo; Seniors Michael McNicholas (13-30&mdash;43) and Jason Salvaggio (23-13&mdash;36) are the top returning scorers. The freshman class includes three NHL draft picks: defenseman Max Gildon, taken in the third round by Florida; defenseman Benton Maass, taken by Washington in the sixth; and goalie Mike Robinson, taken by San Jose in the third. Senior Daniel Tirone had a 2.99 GAA and a .910 save percentage last year. </p><p class="noprint">

<b class="b">Coach</b>: Kevin Sneddon (224-239-68, 15th year).</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Last year</b>: 20-13-5, 10-8-5 Hockey East.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to BC in Hockey East quarterfinals.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: The Catamounts have averaged more than 19 wins per season over the last four years, with three 20-plus campaigns. They finished in sixth place last season but lost leading scorer Mario Puskarich (29 points) and top-scoring defenseman Rob Hamilton (10-11&mdash;21). Returning are sophomore Ross Colton, a Hockey East All-Rookie selection, who tied for second in scoring with 12 goals and 27 points with rising junior Brian Bowen (12-15&mdash;27). Among the recruits is forward Bryce Misley, a Minnesota draft pick. Goalie Stefano Lekkas was 17-10-5 in his freshman year with a 2.61 GAA and .909 save percentage.</p><p class="noprint">

<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Vermont in Hockey East first round.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: Last season&rsquo;s Nos. 3 and 4 scorers, senior Nolan Vesey (13-10&mdash;23) and sophomore Chase Pearson (14-8&mdash;22), return to pace the Black Bear offense, hoping to improve on last year&rsquo;s 11th-place finish. There is experience in goal in junior Rob McGovern (3.02 GAA, .911 save percentage).</p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>CONNECTICUT</subhead-tracks>

<b class="b">Coach</b>: Mike Cavanaugh, 51-70-23, fifth year.</p><p class="noprint">

<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Northeastern in Hockey East first round. </p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: The Huskies are coming off a year in which they collected their most conference wins (8) and points (20) while finishing ninth in their fourth season in the conference. UConn lost scoring star Tage Thompson (19-13&mdash;32) to the Blues. That leaves junior Maxim Letunov (7-20&mdash;27) to spark the offense. Adam Huska was 7-9-4 in goal as a freshman with a 2.87 GAA and a .916 save percentage. </p><p class="noprint">
<subhead-tracks>UMASS</subhead-tracks>
</p><p class="noprint">

<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Providence in Hockey East first round<b class="b">.</b>
</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: After last season&rsquo;s last-place finish, the Minutemen hope that adding defenseman Cale Makar, a fourth-round pick in the NHL Draft and the highest pick in UMass history, can spark the team. A freshman goalie, Matt Murray, is competing for the top spot. Carvel has brought in nearly a whole team of freshmen as the second-year mentor tries to upgrade the team.</p><p class="noprint"></p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">And the other Division 1 team in Boston:</h2>

<b class="b">Postseason</b>: Lost to Duluth in NCAA semifinals.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Outlook</b>: The fourth-ranked Crimson lost four top-notch scorers: Alexander Kerfoot (16-29&mdash;45), Sean Malone (18-24&mdash;42), Tyler Moy (22-23&mdash;45), and Luke Esposito (16-20&mdash;36), so to get back to the Frozen Four, they will be forced to lean heavily on Bruins prospect Ryan Donato (21-19&mdash;40), a junior. Eight freshmen have joined up, including Jack Donato (Dexter, Cape Cod Whalers), Ryan&rsquo;s younger brother. Other new forwards are Jack Badini (Greenwich, USHL&rsquo;s Chicago Steel), Mitchell Perreault (Sioux Falls Stampede), and Benjamin Solin (Exeter, Nanaimo Clippers). On defense, Harvard adds Benjamin Foley of Edina, Minn., Nick Azar (Tri-City Storm), and Reilly Walsh (Proctor, U18 Team USA). Sophomore Adam Fox (6-34&mdash;40) paces the defense after leading the nation in scoring among defensemen. Senior Merrick Madsen (2.11 GAA, .923 save percentage) had a strong finish, earning Most Outstanding Player honors in both the ECAC tournament and the NCAA East Regional.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>
