National Rifle Association signs are omnipresent, as the track hosts the only race in NASCAR&rsquo;s top circuit with NRA branding. A pop-up city of RVs sprawls outside the speedway, with many displaying spreads of barbecue and booze.

<p>&ldquo;Trump is the only one standing up and saying what we think, and it&rsquo;s getting him in trouble,&rdquo; said Jerry McVay, 59, after examining a display of gold-plated firearms for sale bearing Trump&rsquo;s motto: Make America Great Again. &ldquo;The ones that didn&rsquo;t vote for him are acting like little brats.&rdquo;</p><div class="wide">

</div><p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s seven months in Washington have netted little in the way of meaningful legislative accomplishments or even enforceable executive edicts. Yet many in this crowd said they feel more permission to be outspoken on issues once viewed as sensitive, like race. And in interviews with more than 50 fans here, nearly all have seen divisions in their lives growing wider, with sharper lines between those who support Trump and those who don&rsquo;t.</p><p>The president&rsquo;s unapologetic style most recently caused controversy after he insisted that there was blame on both sides for the violence at a rally of white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Va. A peaceful protester was killed there when a car plowed into a crowd, and a man who had earlier been photographed at the white supremacist protest has been charged with second-degree murder. It&rsquo;s become the darkest chapter of Trump&rsquo;s short presidency.</p><p>In Boston during the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched against bigotry and hate, a counterprotest that completely eclipsed the roughly 50 who heeded the call of the Boston Free Speech Coalition, an organization that civil rights activists claim is linked to hate groups. After a Twitter post in which Trump referred to &ldquo;many anti-police agitators&rdquo; in Boston, the president offered supportive words for the anti-hate protesters. &ldquo;I want to applaud the many protesters in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate,&rdquo; he tweeted. &ldquo;Our country will soon come together as one!&rdquo;</p><div class="wide">

<p>But here at the speedway, demonstrations like the one in Boston were viewed as anti-Trump statements from a part of the country that doesn&rsquo;t support the president. This is the deep well of strength Trump has tapped: people who don&rsquo;t consider themselves extremists but find fault with what they see as liberals who won&rsquo;t embrace the president.</p><p>The notion of the &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; was mocked by many in the crowd. Some took turns riding a blow-up bull at one campsite that race-goers named &ldquo;Jenner&rdquo; after Caitlyn Jenner, the most prominent transgender woman in the country. One man explained that he doesn&rsquo;t talk politics with his wife because she&rsquo;s &ldquo;uninformed.&rdquo;</p><p>
<b class="b"></b>&ldquo;The white people are starting to stand up,&rdquo; said Miller &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Fulton, 56, who sat out near his camper sipping beer one evening last week with his son. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a movement going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Fulton, who drove to the racetrack from Ohio, wanted to be clear about one thing: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Klan member. I&rsquo;m not a racist.&rdquo;</p><p>He was already looking to the 2018 midterm elections, in which he believed voters would elect candidates to Congress who would be more supportive of Trump&rsquo;s agenda. He predicted more demonstrations like the ones in Charlottesville.</p><p>To underline his point, Fulton gestured to the campground dotted with Confederate banners and said: &ldquo;Look at all the flags flying.&rdquo;</p><p></p><div class="wide">

Paul Peary, 52, bought it after the Charlottesville demonstrations to support keeping Confederate monuments in place.</p><p>&ldquo;With what&rsquo;s going on with the statues, that is a part of American history that is being snuffed out,&rdquo; said Paul Peary, echoing an argument made by Trump.</p><p>Though NASCAR tried to <a class="a" href="http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/2/statement-nascar-tracks-confederate-flag.html" target="_blank">discourage </a>flying the Confederate flag in 2015, fans rebelled, and this week T-shirts with the flag were for sale along with the banner by the racetrack.</p><p>The Pearys also flew a flag with Trump&rsquo;s name on it &mdash; a display that hardly stood out on the campgrounds. They said nobody asked them about it.</p><p>But in the world beyond Bristol&rsquo;s NASCAR gathering, the Pearys&rsquo; display had caused outcry &mdash; and opened one more microdivision in a country where social groups are increasingly splitting along political lines.</p><p>Cathy Peary, 55, posted a photo of the flags on a Facebook group called &ldquo;RV Pajama Party&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s mostly filled with recreational vehicle enthusiasts posting funny photos of themselves.</p><p>The picture drew immediate ire from the group, as more than 200 comments poured in, many of them negative. The group&rsquo;s organizer asked Cathy Peary to delete the picture.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s called freedom of speech. If these people don&rsquo;t want to support our president of the United States, forget it,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just amazing. It&rsquo;s just totally amazing.&rdquo;</p><p>She decided then and there to withdraw from the group of more than 10,000 members, even though she was one of the earliest members.</p><p></p><div class="wide">

</div><p>During the 2016 campaign, NASCAR CEO Brian France cemented a tie between the sport and Trump, the then-controversial Republican front-runner. France appeared at a Trump rally in February 2016, held in Valdosta, Ga., just before Super Tuesday, <a class="a" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/super-tuesday-preview-republican-presidential-election-2016/" target="_blank">when </a>11 states voted in the Republican primaries and caucuses.</p><p>&ldquo;He wins with his family,&rdquo; France said, <a class="a" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2016/02/29/nascar-ceo-brian-france-ryan-newman-david-ragan-chase-eliott-endorse-donald-trump-president/81130770/" target="_blank">according </a>to media accounts. &ldquo;Any of his children, you&rsquo;d be proud to have them as part of your family. That&rsquo;s how I judge a winner, how somebody manages their family and raises their family.&rdquo;</p><p>France declined to comment for this story. But NASCAR officialdom has offered generalized remarks about Charlottesville, appearing to conflate the violence there with the terror attack in Barcelona on Thursday that killed 14 and injured 80 people. &ldquo;We are saddened by recent tragic events around the world and feel strongly there is no place for bigotry, racism, hatred, or violence in our society,&rdquo; said Brent Dewar, the president of NASCAR, in a statement to the Globe.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="wide">
