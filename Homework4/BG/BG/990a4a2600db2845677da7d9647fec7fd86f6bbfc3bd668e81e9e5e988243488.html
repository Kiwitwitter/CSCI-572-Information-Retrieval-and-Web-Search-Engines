<p>Molitor spent the entire season in the final year of his initial three-year contract signed in 2014. New executives <b class="b">Derek Falvey </b>and <b class="b">Thad Levine </b>never addressed the manager&rsquo;s future during the season, which saw a 26-game improvement from 2016. That led to some uncertainty about whether they would retain a manager they inherited when they took over.</p><amp-iframe width="auto" height="220" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms" layout="fixed-height" frameborder="0" src="https://c.a0bg.com/Fragment/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/skins/leaf/story/dynamic_newsletter.jpt?section=%2fsports%2fredsox&googleArticle=yes"></amp-iframe>

<p>But with Molitor among the front-runners for AL manager of the year, the sides reached agreement on a new deal less than a week after the season ended.</p><p>Molitor, a St. Paul native who spent the final three seasons of a Hall of Fame career with the Twins, has earned the loyalty and respect of his players with an even-keeled demeanor and impressive grasp of the game. Prior to being hired as manager, he served as a roving instructor in the Twins&rsquo; minor league system, forging strong bonds with players such as <b class="b">Brian Dozier</b>, <b class="b">Miguel Sano</b>, and <b class="b">Byron Buxton </b>that laid the groundwork for this season&rsquo;s renaissance.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s our skipper. He&rsquo;s our leader,&rsquo;&rsquo; Dozier said after the Twins were eliminated by the Yankees. &lsquo;&lsquo;He does so much, having his hands on every single thing When you've got a guy like that, we feel lucky.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Molitor was hired to replace longtime manager <b class="b">Ron Gardenhire </b>for the 2015 season. The Twins were coming off of their fourth straight season of 90-plus losses, but Molitor spearheaded a surprisingly competitive 83-79 year that kept them in the playoff conversation deep into September.</p><p class="skip-nav article-more">

<p>Then came the disastrous 2016 season in which the Twins lost 103 games, looking hapless in the field, on the base paths, and on the mound. They lost more games than any Twins team that came before them and ushered respected general manager <b class="b">Terry Ryan </b>out the door.</p><p>Owner <b class="b">Jim Pohlad </b>hired Falvey from the Indians and Levine from the Rangers to oversee the rebuild, a pair of uncharacteristic moves for an owner who has long been known for promoting from within. Pohlad made keeping Molitor through the final year of his contract a prerequisite for accepting the position, a set of circumstances that had skeptics believing Molitor&rsquo;s time in Minnesota was nearing an end.</p><p class="noprint">Over the last two months of the season as the Twins surged back into playoff contention, Falvey and Levine remained noncommittal when asked about Molitor&rsquo;s status. There remained a possibility that Falvey and Levine would still decide to part ways with Molitor and conduct their own search to bring in their own manager.</p><p class="noprint">In a season that saw Buxton break out after looking overwhelmed early in his career, <b class="b">Joe Mauer&rsquo;s </b>return to be a .300 hitter and the team&rsquo;s return to the postseason for the first time since 2010, the list of successes grew too long to ignore.  The decision to bring him back no doubt comes as a welcome one for Pohlad, whose family has employed just three managers since 1986.</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Two surgeries for Reds&rsquo; Davis</h2>
</h3><p>Reds righthander <b class="b">Rookie Davis </b>had surgery to repair a torn labrum and remove a bone spur in his right hip. His recovery is expected to extend into spring training.</p><p>He made his major league debut this season and went 1-3 with an 8.63 ERA in six starts and one relief appearance. He was one of 10 rookies who started for the Reds during the season, six of them making their major league debuts.</p><p class="noprint">Davis last started against the Cardinals Sept. 20 and gave up five runs, including three homers, in three innings of a 9-2 loss.</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Angels, Cubs make deal</h2>
</h3><p>The Angels acquired righthanded reliever <b class="b">Felix Pena </b>from the Cubs in exchange for cash or a player to be named. Diaz was designated for assignment by Chicago last week.</p><p>Los Angeles also designated lefthander <b class="b">Jason Gurka </b>for assignment.</p><p>Diaz had a 4.98 ERA in 36 appearances with the Cubs over the past two seasons.

<h2 class="subhead">Mets move Triple A team</h2>
</h3><p>The Mets are buying the Triple A Syracuse Chiefs as they work toward centering more of their minor league baseball operations in their home state.</p><p class="noprint">
<b class="b">Governor Andrew Cuomo </b>confirmed the deal, calling it &lsquo;&lsquo;a home run that ensures the Chiefs stay right where they belong while the next generation of &lsquo;amazin&rsquo; greats is fostered right here in central New York.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>Cuomo is scheduled to appear in Syracuse on Tuesday at NBT Bank Stadium, the team&rsquo;s home, for a formal announcement. The Mets will make Syracuse their top minor league affiliate beginning in 2019.</p><p>New York&rsquo;s current Triple A affiliate is in Las Vegas, and the distance has led to problems with quick call-ups after injuries and extra-inning games.</p><p>The Mets had a Triple A affiliate in Buffalo from 2009-12 before moving to Las Vegas.</p><p>The Mets also own the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Double A Eastern League.</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Fan sues for injuries</h2>
</h3><p>A man who was left blind in one eye &mdash; at least temporarily &mdash; and may ultimately lose the eye after a foul ball struck him in the face at Wrigley Field this summer has filed a lawsuit against the Cubs and Major League Baseball, alleging that they have failed to install enough safety netting to protect him and other fans.</p><p>At a news conference 60-year-old <b class="b">John &lsquo;&lsquo;Jay&rsquo;&rsquo; Loos </b>said he has undergone three surgeries to repair his severely damaged left eye and the five bones in his face shattered by the foul ball that struck him as he sat down the first-base line during a game between the Cubs and the Pirates on Aug. 29.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I had no idea that you were subjected to such missiles,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Loos, whose eye was heavily bandaged. &lsquo;&lsquo;You could be there with a mitt and you wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to react in time.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>With the lawsuit, Loos joins a growing chorus of critics who after recent incidents to call on Major League teams to extend the safety netting farther down the lines to protect fans sitting there like the netting that protects the fans sitting behind home plate. There also was an incident last month at New York&rsquo;s Yankee Stadium in which a 2-year-old was struck in the face by a line drive.</p><p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Fans are the life-blood of Major League Baseball [and] there should be nothing more important than their safety,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Loos, a resident of the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg.</p><p>After the girl was hit in New York, Major League commissioner <b class="b">Rob Manfred </b>said MLB had in recent seasons worked with teams to expand netting in ballparks and would &lsquo;&lsquo;redouble our efforts on this important issue.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p class="noprint">A spokesman for the Cubs said the team had not seen the lawsuit but declined comment. Days after the child was struck in New York, Cubs president of business operations <b class="b">Crane Kenney </b>said the team would extend the netting already in place by at least 30 feet down lines. And on Monday, an attorney for Loos, <b class="b">Colin Dunn</b>, said he&rsquo;d contacted the Cubs and was encouraged by what they said. He declined to elaborate.</p><p class="noprint">&lsquo;&lsquo;I have talked to them and I do believe that they will do the right thing for Jay,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Dunn, whose lawsuit seeks damages of at least $50,000. &lsquo;&lsquo;I think they care about their fans.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p></div>
