<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With just two seniors on the roster and not many returning starters, what this season&rsquo;s Boston English team lacks in experience it makes up for in enthusiasm. &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re young, we&rsquo;re hungry, and the kids have a great attitude,&rsquo;&rsquo; English coach Ryan Conway said. One of the senior leaders ready for an impact season is offensive and defensive lineman Cyril Blair. Junior safety David Robinson and running back Garry Robinson are also poised for big years. English saw a lot of their upperclassmen transfer after last season and now coach Conway is trying to establish as much consistency in the program as he can. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to change the culture of English football,&rsquo;&rsquo; Conway said. &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m these seniors third head coach so there hasn&rsquo;t been to much consistency here. The goal is to get better every day and create a family environment.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 6 p.m., vs. O&rsquo;Bryant</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Burke</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Byron Beaman (7th season). Career: 19-44.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 5-5</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Experience.</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Depth.</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Multiple</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Burke is looking to improve on last season&rsquo;s 5-5 mark. The Bulldogs scored an average of 18 points per game while allowing 20.6 points a season ago. It&rsquo;s not out of the question to think Burke can improve with running back Israel Lara returning for his senior campaign. Defensively, linebacker Rishaad Sheppard will anchor the middle of the field. Cornerback Ernst Clercin will look to solidify the secondary while defensive end Jawon Stone is a force up front. Burke will need to find a new quarterback this season but if they fill that role they could be a dangourous team in the Boston City League South.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 15, 7 p.m., at Weston</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Cathedral</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> Paul Sobolewski (2nd season). Career: 9-2 (64-67 overall).</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 9-2</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Offensive line, running backs.</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Depth.</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Running back Khalil Blair exploded onto the scene last season, leading Division 4 in scoring with 31 touchdowns. Blair is back and ready to pick up where he left off. Cathedral will also have quarterback Anthony Mejia and running back Khamal Headon back this season along with four of last years starting offensive lineman, making the Panthers one of the more dangerous offenses in Division 8. Senior Randy Williams will be starting at center for the third year while 6-foot-2 260-pound tackle Jose Delosantos is also returning for his senior campaign. Cathedral has seven returners on defense led by linebacker Ajan Nelson. Cathedral is trying not to look too far ahead but it&rsquo;s easy to envision this team making a deep tournament run.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 6 p.m., at Latin Academy</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Charlestown</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> David Cahill (4th season). Career: 3-25.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 1-8</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Quarterback.</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Inexperience at skill positions.</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Spread</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With just one returning starter from last season the Charlestown football team will have a lot of new players on the field come week one. Center Deandre Smith is the lone returner for the Townies. Despite the lack of returners Charlestown is entering the season with experience at quarterback. After transferring from South Boston, Steven Williams is set to make his Charlestown debut under center. Williams is a talented passer and ran a similar spread attack with the Knights last year. The addition of Williams allowed Charlestown to move Quarmise Epps from quarterback to his natural position of receiver, giving Williams a dependable option on the outside.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Saturday, Sept. 16, 2 p.m., at Pope John</p><h3 class="subhead">
<h2 class="subhead">Lynn Tech</h2>
</h3><p>
<b class="b">Coach:</b> James Runner (8th season). Career: 30-44.</p><p>
<b class="b">Last year&rsquo;s record:</b> 4-7</p><p>
<b class="b">Strengths:</b> Experience, depth, senior leadership.</p><p>
<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Inexperience at defensive line.</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Multiple</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Lynn Tech is looking to build off a 2016 campaign which ended in the Division 4 quarterfinals; and with 15 returning starters (eight on offense, seven on defense) they may be in a position to do just that. The Tigers have a run first offense with Steffan Gravely and Keoni Gaskin combining for a dynamic backfield and senior captain Kevin Aguilar anchoring the offensive line. Senior captain Marcus Taylor is the leader on defense where he&rsquo;ll anchor the secondary. The Tigers will have to start the year with a new quarterback but coach James Runner is confident in junior David Barrios. &lsquo;&lsquo;David is a phenomenal athlete. He&rsquo;s a hurdler for us in track, and he just has the most unbelievable drive,&rsquo;&rsquo; Runner said of Barrios. &lsquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a great athlete but he&rsquo;s an even better decision maker. We don&rsquo;t really pass the ball to much but when we do pass he makes me feel good because he&rsquo;s efficient.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Depth.</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Wing T</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After a 3-6 season last year Madison Park will try to climb out of the basement of the Boston City League standings. To do that MP will have to find a way to replace the production of quarterback Jordan Pimentel, and running back Stephon Anderson, both of whom graduated last season. The Cardinals scored an average of 11.8 points per game last year while allowing an average of 22.6 per game. Madison Park has a lot of young players so coach Roosevelt Robinson is stressing fundamental football in the early part of the season. If they can get the fundamentals down, look for Madison Park to make a splash in the City League this year.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With seven starters returning, including at quarterback, running back, and receiver, the Mustangs are poised to have a potent offensive attack. Quarterback Emmanuel Capellan, running back Miguel Perez, and receivers Jose Morales and DeShawn Lopez are all back this season. While the Mustang offense is full of experience, the defense will have a lot of new faces. According to coach Harry LaSage the defense preformed well in the team&rsquo;s first scrimmage, but tackling is an area that needs improvement. One goal is to work better as a team. &lsquo;&lsquo;The kids realized that working together as a team is how we&rsquo;re going to have a successful season.&rsquo;&rsquo; LaSage said.</p><p>

<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With five returning starters on both sides of the ball, Matignon will enter the season with experience at the skill positions. Running back Jayhai Aubri is back in the backfield after leading the team in rushing touchdowns last year. The Warriors also have talented receivers with Pat Macaroni and Connor Lewis both returning. Matignon coach Michael Hill is also excited about first-year receiver John Giannone. Giannone is an explosive athlete with the potential to develop into a deep threat for the Warriors.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Grass</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After a tough 0-10 season last year, Minuteman will have its hands full replacing productive quarterback Dave Andrade and running back Sam Lackey. Junior running back Ngnor Manyang will be replacing much of the production in the backfield. Junior Darian Casseus is another backfield option. Casseus is elusive out of the backfield but can also be a viable passing option. Minuteman averaged just 11.8 points per game last season. If they can score a few more points this team could add a few tallies to the win column.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> New Mission is entering the season with 11 returning starters. But with most of the returning experience on the defensive side of the ball, the Titans offense will take some time to get up to speed. New Mission will need to find new starters at quarterback, running back, and receiver. Takaki Hobbs looks to replace the production in the backfield while Dradae&rsquo; Montissoi will be a threat on the outside. Andrew Franklin and Tristan Champagne are battling for the starting quarterback position and New Mission coach Michael Pittman-Foreman hasn&rsquo;t ruled out using both quarterbacks depending on the scheme. Champagne is a more traditional quarterback with good arm strength and accuracy while Franklin, a converted running back, is a better athlete. Defensively, New Mission is more sound with six returning starters. Lineman Chris Marks will be the leader on the defensive side of the ball.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> The big guys up front seldom get much credit, but their success often drives the offensive unit. With four returning starters, the South Boston offensive line is the strength of the team. Wilson Sanon, Carols Iobolo, Marcos Roman, and Jason Dorsainvil are all back this season, and will be joined by guard Jaleel Orlebar. South Boston&rsquo;s offense returns six starters but will have big holes to fill, including at quarterback. With a small roster, coach Germaine Sattiewhite has elected to push his players mentally rather than physically this preseason in an effort to reduce injuries. The team won&rsquo;t scrimmage, so the September 16 game against Atlantis Charter will be the first look at Sattiewhite&rsquo;s new pro set offense.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> Tech Boston has a potent spread attack and has put up a lot of points in recent years. This year should be no different as the Bears enter the season with seven returning starters on offense. The returners include running back Ajaye Cooper, wide receiver Marcus Gonzalez and all-around athlete Jaron Harrison. Defensively, linebackers Mason Osorio and Devondre Morgan will be calling the shots. Tech Boston is returning five starters on defense but did lose starters on the defensive line. If the new defensive linemen perform well the Bears will be right in the mix in the Boston City League.</p><p>

<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> With seven returning starters on each side of the ball, West Roxbury is entering the season with a good amount of experience. One position that will need to be filled is quarterback. Erven Exhilhomme is the favorite to land the starting job after filling in at times last season. Michael Cruz will be back for the Raiders at running back along with Louis Pina. The offensive line is a cause for concern entering the season as West Roxbury graduated three starters from last year. Derek Bertucci will be the leader on this year&rsquo;s unit. After a 3-8 season, coach Derek Wright&rsquo;s biggest goal for this fall is to just improve week to week. &lsquo;&lsquo;As far as expectations, I just look for them to improve each week,&rsquo;&rsquo; Wright said. &lsquo;&lsquo;As long as they continue to improve I&rsquo;d be happy with that.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>

Although the Mohawks lost three offensive players for the upcoming season, they are relying on their star quarterback Bryce Latosek and running back Kurt Hopkins to lead the team.

<b class="b">Concerns:</b> Depth</p><p>
<b class="b">Offense:</b> Multiple</p><p>
<b class="b">Playing surface:</b> Artificial turf</p><p>
<b class="b">Outlook:</b> After a 41-12 loss to Abington in the Division 4A South quarterfinals last year, coach Bill Panos hopes to see his Warriors advance further in the postseason this season. &lsquo;&lsquo;I hope to get into the playoffs,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;&lsquo;We have been in the playoffs the last couple of years but I hope to win that first game which has been avoiding us.&rsquo;&rsquo; Panos expects big things from sophomore Matt Lavoie, who will replace his graduated brother Justin Lavoie at quarterback.</p><p>
<b class="b">Season opener:</b> Friday, Sept. 8, 7 p.m., vs. Diman</p></div>
